",Just do a bit of GD,Don't fake around in the psychometric test. Just choose whatever seems logical to you. Prepare resume properly with action verbs. Try to emphasize management skills you gained from past experience in the interview.
Aditya Vats,BT,ME,M,ITC Limited,Techno-Managerial,HUL,"1) The first round is filling a very detailed form. This constitutes everyThing from your achievements to your life goals etc. I believe it’s to understand how actively you are engaged in progressing your career and yourself.

2) Second round is basically the short listing for GD. The short listing is done on the basis of your form, your CPI, and your resume. I believe a CPI > 8.5 will suffice.

3) My GD was online and it was a very quick case study. A situation was provided and 3-4 people were asked to come to a consensus for a solution. The selection over this was pretty much how any GD selection goes. You speak up, speak logically, don’t criticise, be courteous but put your point across. 

4) After getting selected, you have another 2 rounds of interviews. You must be very thorough with your resume. Technical questions were asked of me but not related to my coursework. Some general stuff like what motors do we use in our bot (related to a project of mine). So have at least 10 minutes of speaking content on each of your project points (yup, 10 minutes for each bullet point). Be very thorough here.

5) Almost all the questions were about your resume points. So if you had written for eg something about Random Forest Classifiers, they are going to go to the depth of it. So ensure that you are able to justify all your points.They may ask very unrelated questions, that they know you don’t have the technical expertise to know. These are just to ensure you don’t get baffled by stuff. Stay calm and answer to the best of your abilities.","I was not really preparing much for internship. I had done some GD practice with my friends, at least 3-4 mock GDs. Was doing some coding on interviewbit and some quant practice (50 challenging problems etc). I was not very rigorous in my prep. What helped me I guess, was that I had done lot of work in my semester time. Projects, Teams, Internship. All that actually helped me in the ITC shortlisting.","I would suggest to stay calm and relaxed in interviews. A relaxed and positive vibe actually creates a big difference in such interviews. Nobody wants a nervous wreck in their company. So smile, make light conversation with the interviewers while answering their questions seriously. That shows that you are confident in dealing with new situations."
Shubham Sanjay Korde,BT,EE,M,ITC Limited,Techno-Managerial,Hindustan Unilever (Techno Managerial),"Shortlist
- Shortlisting done on the basis of Resume + Application form
- A good CGPA helps
- Having a project and a POR beneficial 

GD 
- Group Discussion with a batch of 6 people
- Common problem statement is given. You have to choose an option and try to convince others why that options should be choosen.
- Sample Question: There are 5 people who want to get an apartment in the residential complex. The traits and characteristics of all the 5 were given. Like one of them was the senior most, one did crucial time sensitive jobs, one was handicapped and so on. We had to decide and explain whom to give the room and convince everyone else why that was the correct choice.

Interviews
- 2 rounds of interviews: 1 technical and 1 HR
- Explain one of the projects on your resume.
- What are the two important internationally important topics you deeply feel about? (HR)
- Which will be your ideal company to join apart from ITC? (HR)
- All other questions were resume specific (most of it was  conversations)


General Insights
- Having a good CGPA makes selection way easier
- Clear speech, logical structure in arguments and persuasiveness in manner beneficial in clearing the GD. Exposure to public speaking and GD practices will surely help. 
- Basic questions on core courses like EE330, ESO203, ESC201 can be asked. Although I was asked none. Same for Mechanical and Chemical core courses
- Have basic info for HR round like CEO name, products of the company, primary business market etc.","- I did not specifically prepare for techno managerial profiles. I had been debating for a couple of years by then so it was relatively easier for me to crack the GD.
- I watched a couple of youtube videos on basic tips to perform well GD before the GD.
- Do not forget to ask your friends who have already been in one of the previous batches what the question was. I knew the question well in advance before the GD. Although the question was not super difficult, it could make a difference if you get more time to think about your answer.
- I watched youtube videos on HR interview questions and correct answers to them. None of them helped as HR interviews are basically conversations. 
","- Have backup options ready if your target is techno-managerial profile because the number of good companies in this profile are very few. It is also possible because preparing for this profile does not require much hardwork.
- If you have never done any kind of public speaking or any such activity, practicing GD with your friends can be really helpful.
- Be as frank as you could during the interview. No need to fake. Most times the people interviewing you are extremely pleasant and make you feel comfortable. Take the interview just like a conversation. You wont even know when did the interview end.
- Don’t worry if you don’t get it. A significant part of the process is luck."
Chaitanya Sahni,BT,ME,M,ITC Limited,Techno-Managerial,Hindustan Unilever (Techno Managerial),"1. Resume Shortlist and personal questionnaire form : High CPI is important
2. GD: Directed GD amd GD usually presents a moral dilemma as topic where you choose what to give priority to.
3. Interview Process: There were 2 interviews in total post GD. The first interview was more on the technical side whereas the second was a general interview seeking to know more about your personality.

The personal questions form should be filled with care. The answers should show clarity in the direction you are headed. For the GD the best steps to follow are to be aware of others peoples points and not repeat. Also you should try to bring a different angle from others. Stick to your decisions and make arguments in a formal manner.

The GD question for me was related to a company which gave workers houses within the company plant. The house allocation was usually done on seniority basis however we were presented with a dilemma in this case were there were some special cases in addition to the senior most worker. We were to decide based on this who we would allocate the house to. The technical interview was focused primarily on my resume. They asked in depth about projects I was pursuing and some course related questions as well.",My preparation for the GD was done by interacting with some seniors and taking part in mock GD’s arranged by the ANC. After the GD I did some basic research into standard interview questions and prepared myself for those. Apart from this I also did some background research on the company I was interviewing for. We must be prepared for what we have written in our resume as they will surely pick up on those points and ask to explain them.,"Be thorough while preparing resume. Do not panic or feel dejected when you do not see your name in the list. Intern season is stressful, prepare well beforehand and dedicate time daily for your betterment. Apart from this focus on your soft skills as they also play an important role to get you intern."
