## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Optiver, D.E Shaw, Graviton, Samsung Korea

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
I practiced coding from leetcode, interviewbit and for quant I practiced from brainstellar.com and Heard on the Street.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
In my quadeye interview, I was asked probability questions and also a few puzzles. Also in the second and third round of the interview a few questions on coding were also asked, though they were not as difficult as asked in software roles of other companies. For quadeye, I felt their main focus was on aptitude based problems as it was for quant role.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Rigorously practice on interviewbit or leetcode as you see fit and try and solve using hints before jumping to see the solutions. Keep some time before the interviews to revise and consolidate on the tricky problems. Also if applying for a quant role as well, start devoting some time to probability and puzzles and do not leave them for the last day. Also prepare a few answers for common questions "Tell me about yourself" or "Do you have any questions for me".
