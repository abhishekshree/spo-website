## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
None  

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
InterviewBit, LeetCode, and GFG for coding and Coursera for ML Basics

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
There was only one interview round and it mostly revolved around what all I have mentioned in my resume. My projects had ML aspects and the interviewer asked me questions based on that. I was also asked a coding question (Activity Selection Problem) and some questions about why I was interested in doing research. 

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
If you're looking to do a research internship in the corporate domain, such as Adobe research, make sure you do relevant projects (in my case, ML). In your interview, it is important that you are able if to explain everything you did as part of the projects. Good CPI is a plus for Adobe, though it didn't matter much in my case. Start coding. Practice problems on platforms such as InterviewBit or LeetCode. 
Topics for Adobe's test: DSA, Linear algebra, Probability and statistics.
