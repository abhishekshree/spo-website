## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Do DSA by heart else you will have very less chance of securing a great internship, competitive programming was the reason I was not shortlisted for any firm on day1:( but if you are not doing it work on other aspects like communication skills or great projects and practice with timer basic aptitude questions as some firms ask only aptitude.
