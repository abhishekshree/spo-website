## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Interviewbit, Geeks for Geeks, Brainstellar

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Round 1 : I was asked several questions on Computer Networking, OS, basic DSA and some other CS fundamentals.
Round 2 : I was asked some technical questions about networking, OOPs and OS, and then some general questions.
Round 3 : I was asked 4-5 HR questions, and then was explained about the location preference and stipend.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Start coding at least from the beginning of your fourth semester. This will make you very comfortable with coding, and you'll be able to clear most of the technical rounds.
Keep solving puzzles on Interviewbit and brainstellar.
Solve company-wise problems on GFG before going to the interview.
Take guidance from your seniors. Most of them will be ready to offer a lending hand.
