## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Google,rubrik,uber,graviton,tower,quadeye,microsoft,sprinklr

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
interview bit , code forces

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
In SDE role , most of the interviews are based upon algorithms and Data Structures only. You will be given questions and you will have to solve them and write code/pseudo code and then even explain it. Explaining is the most important step. Also try to give good names to variables, in one of the interview I was asked to change all the variable names so that the code looks good. Also in some cases you might be asked questions from some of the courses , but that chance of asking that is less.

In quant roles, generally  puzzles and probability questions are asked. 

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Try to wrap up all the things you do in summers by June end . From July the things get a bit time consuming , you will first have to give time to make resume and then the coding rounds are soon lined up and then preparing for interview. All this require much time.
Also do practise from the test series from archives , they are really good set of question.
