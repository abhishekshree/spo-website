## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
On Day-1 was shortlisted only for DE shaw only

Interview Bit ( Programming and Puzzles)
Codeforces( for pclub contests only)
CSES Problem Set (to consolidate a topic if enough time is there)
Competitive Programming - 3 
(BOOK by Steven Halim and Felix Halim)
Brainsteller
GeeksforGeeks

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Questions Related to Dynamic Programming, Graphs and Binary search and very basic questions regarding OOPS were asked.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Most important thing is to have good peer group for discussing questions, find people with common interest, keep giving contests organized by pclub and you must keep learning things which you don't know and due to which you were not able to solve a particular question in company tests and contests. My personal advice would be to First do each and every question from Interview Bit and keep learning things you don't know from geeks for geeks, for graphs and Binary search read theory (no need to do questions if you don't have much time) from the book I mentioned( CP-3 by Halim). For DP do every question from Interview Bit and also do some questions from CSES problem set for building confidence, for quant profile do Brainsteller and interview bit Puzzles, if you get stuck refer to GeeksforGeeks for that question and YouTube if still not clear
