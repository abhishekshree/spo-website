## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
None 

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
CP questions from InterviewBit and Theory of DSA from GfG and YT
For Quant, I did Brainstellar (probability and the Discrete Maths section), 50 Challenging Problems and if time is left then do Xinfeng Zhou (A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews)
HR : InterviewBit's most commonly asked HR questions, PrepLeaf Interview Preparation Playlist

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
The shortlisting test was based on CP. One question on Arrays and 2 questions on Graphs. Those who did more than 80% were shortlisted imo.

There were two interview rounds for the Technology Role in American Express. My round 1 was a little different from others. It was of 15 minutes, 2 questions were asked, one on stacks - sort an array using two stacks and another was a simple question on Binary Search 
Round 2 was of 1 Hour. Behavioral HR Questions were asked and we were expected to give a detailed answer of what we would do in such a situation. Next Questions related to projects were asked. In the last if we wanted to ask some questions from the interviewer.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Intern Season Preparation can be stressful at times therefore its important to remain in contact with your friends as well as seniors who may motivate you in your lows. 
Many a times you would get stuck while solving problems, don't worry that's normal and happens with everyone, take a break and then continue. Never hesitate to ask your friends for help.
Talk to the seniors of the profile for which you are preparing for, its important that you utilise your time wisely for intern prep during the vacations and not just completely focus on internships or projects. 
Get your resume reviewed by as many seniors as possible
Getting an intern also requires a bit of luck so don't get disheartened if you don't get an intern in the earlier days. Try to be consistent in your preparation.
