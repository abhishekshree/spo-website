## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
I have only 1 round of interview with microsoft as I was a part of engage mentorship program. The round named as AA round (As Appropritate). There is only one interviewer  and he have an experience of more than 20 years with microsoft. Since, I was a part of mentorship program, intial 15 mins discussion was on my project, he asked me to give a quick demo of my project then  he asked me to open the source code and explain them what I have done and why I have done. Then he ask about my previous internship experience in very brief (2-5 min only). After all this, they came to DSA ( Data Structure and Algorithm). He put one sample test case of linked list in the comment box and asked me to predict the possible question. I predicted around 4-5 possible questions. then he give me second test case and I was successfully able to predict the questions. The question is very simple once you predict the question. The question is as follows : Given a linked list, split it into two halves and then reverse the both halves and connect the end of first linked list. In the end, they ask me to code the same problem.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Prepare well for the coding round . Mostly DP questions are asked in the coding round. Make sure to have a sufficient practice beforehand.
