## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Interviewbit, Geeks for geeks, Brainstellar 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
In the first round , I was asked two coding questions. One was very basic related to hashing and another was a medium level question related to strings. The interview was on hacker rank so I also had to write the code for the both. The second round was a HR round and standard HR questions were asked. Also some projects and points of the resume were discussed. In the both the rounds some questions related to networking and operating systems were asked. 
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Maintain a DECENT CPI as some companies have a CPI shortlisting criteria also. Start preparing as early as possible.  Prepare data structures and algorithms very well. Practice as many as questions as possible and be sure to cover all topics. Choose one platform and stick to it. Practice the questions in time limit as in tests time will be limited. Prepare a good resume. Mention only those points in the resume which you can defend well in the interviews.
