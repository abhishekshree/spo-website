## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
1.) Try to be patient and sit tight , you will see people getting shortlisted and your name not in the list even when you expect it to be , don't loose hope. 
2.) Dont write SQL in your resume if you dont know it inside out . What i mean if you are mentioning use of any technology in your resume then expect questions on it.
3.) Look at what company does before the interview and make sure to ask questions to the interviewer after the interview about his experiences , work life , what you are working on etc.
