## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
None

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
For Quant related preparation, I used 50 challenging problems in probability and puzzles from Brainstellar (Discrete Maths and Probability). One can also use books like "Heard on the street" and Algorithmic Trading book by MaxDama, the brainteasers part of which is quite relevant for quantitive trading related interviews. 

For the SDE related roles, I just did all the questions from InterviewBit and regularly participated in Contests on Codeforces throughout the Summers. For SDE roles, even the Pclub Archives (given as contests on Codeforces) were actually quite helpful. 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
I was quite keen on trying for Quant related roles and hence I applied for almost all of them. I was shortlisted for quite a few of them. Almost all of the interviews try to test your quantitative aptitude along with some of them who check your arithmetic skills as well. Firms like Jane Street and Graviton completely asked questions based on multiplayer games and probability based concepts for maximising your chance of winning or finding an ideal strategy for a particular game. Quadeye asked questions more on the side of probability and discrete math puzzles. I would recommend brainstellar for practising such questions. They also asked problems on arithmetic which required performing calculations mentally. They also asked me some kind of problems on approximating things (for instance, total weight of land on earth) and then asked confidence intervals and stuff like that related to my answer. This is generally what quant interviews look like. I also interviewed for some SDE roles and almost all of them just asked DSA problems and then some knowledge based problems on OOP and Computer Organisation.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
I would say for all of the roles, practising the type of questions asked is really important. Start as early as you can, preferably just around the start of your summers. Try to give as many contests on Cf or Codechef as possible as they nearly simulate the ideal test environment that you will be facing. Try as much problems as you can from sites like InterviewBit and LeetCode. For quant, revise concepts like expectations from CS203/MS0201 and practice problems from books and sites like brainstellar. Also, try to revise some parts of courses like ESO207.
