## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Shortlisted for Bajaj interview

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Thermodynamics (ESO201): Cengel and Boles
Fluids: ME231 notes
Mechanics of Solids: ESO202 notes
TA202: Followed TA202 slides of Dr. Mohit Law and Niraj Sinha
NPTEL videos for some specific topics were also useful
SPO IITK GD preparation material

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Fluids and Heat transfer. It was basically an application of Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer and Fluids in real life problems which we see daily. You don't have to be 100% correct in your answers. Just make sure you are able to give a brief and logical solution to the questions asked. HR questions were situation based. For eg: How did you resolve a conflict, etc. Prepare for HR questions with the help of some seniors in advance
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
For core mech profile, be very thorough with your sem 3 and sem 4 core courses. Some important courses are ESO201, ESO202, ME231/ESO204 or any other fluid mechanics course and TA202. Practice a lot of GDs. A technical project/internship in your resume is also a plus. Prepare for 2 profiles at least to be on the safe side(I only prepared for only core profiles though :p but would advise against it)
