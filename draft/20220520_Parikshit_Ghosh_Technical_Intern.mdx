## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Not Applicable

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Personally, for Chemical Core profile preparation, one needs to be thorough with the core subjects of ESO201 & CHE221- Thermodynamics and CHE211- Fluids.
Apart from courses, one needs to be well prepared for Group Discussion. One will face a GD before the interview, which he/she has to overcome in order to get enlisted for the interviews.
So a few tips for GD are:
1) Be confident and speak with authority.
2) One needs to take the initiative to give the introduction or conclusion in order to better your chance to go to the interviews. But remember, it is a double-edged sword, make sure to be concise and structure the introduction properly.
3) Lastly, be proactive but never cut anybody's point, let them speak and then come to your good point in order to make an impression.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
In my case, the questions were focused on the applications of the projects (in my resume) that I had done. I was asked to explain the applications and implications of the PV plot of ethyl chloride (system could be anything).
Secondly, I was asked why did I apply for the company (Dr. Reddy Laboratories Ltd).
Thirdly, I was interrogated to explain the applications of data science in the pharmaceutical industry.
Fourthly, I was questioned about the impact of COVID-19 on our lives as a whole.
Lastly, I was asked if I would be able to complete the project in 2 months. (trick question, be sure to provide instances from your POR and projects)
Overall, the experience was worthwhile. I feel that I have reinvented into a new and better version of myself.
All the best to everybody (who is reading) this for your intern season! I am sure your hardwork will payoff.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
My advice is that don't get disheartened, try until the very end. If you have worked on your resume and CPI, prepared for your GD and are ready with ESO201, CHE211 concepts. Then you definitely have a good chance to crack the internship. Set your heart ablaze and go all out until the very end, I am sure some company will workout for you.
All the best for your upcoming intern season!
