## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Goldman Sachs

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Codeforces , Geeksforgeeks, Interviewbit 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Google first takes a coding round and shortlist students on the basis of test score and resume. Coding round consist of two problems, I have got one problem on Dijkstra and the other one was based on dp with bit masking. After that they takes two technical interview rounds, In both the interviews I was asked fairly simple problems based on graph and bfs search. mostly they first ask a simple problem and than a harder follow up problem.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Try maintaining a decent cpi as some companies do care about your academic performance. Also try to regularly participate in contests held on competitive programming platforms like codeforces and codechef, it will help you build confidence in your DSA skills.
