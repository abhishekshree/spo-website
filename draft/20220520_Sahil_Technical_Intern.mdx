## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
MasterCard, Bajaj Auto Ltd

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Not so specific as such, i would recommend you to pursue your interest.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Actually my interview was different from usual interviews, so i don't want you to follow my case. I told them about my own startup ideas, and those were for Pharmaceutical companies, so it was a cup of cake for me to clear it. My ideas were of using IOT and computer vision to increase the efficiency of the firm (somewhat similar kind of this, can't tell everything). 
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Focus on your interest rather than jumping on anything randomly, i was sitting for the Software profile, i didn't do any DSA practice (but tho i suggest you must do it), but i had many other stuff in my resume, i.e 3 interns of Software Developer role and two projects (1 of ML, 1 of Data Analytics), 1 Head Web POR.
