## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Nomura and APT-Portfolio

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
For Probability, I used the following- Brainstellar and 50 challenging problems. For theory, MSO201/HSO201 are sufficient but since I hadn't done any of them so I prepared it online.
For Coding, I used Interviewbit and programming club archives. You can also prepare from Leetcode or GeeksforGeeks.
If you are preparing for finance profiles , A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews is a good book containing basic finance theory and probability puzzles
For GD preparations, participating in the mock GD organised by AnC is sufficient.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
So in all of my interviews I was asked about a project I had done in finance profile and had to explain everything about it from its motive, how it was done to its future prospects.
Apart from that, probability puzzles were asked, some of which were directly from brainstellar. In Amex interview, they asked a case study and some company specific questions.
For nomura specific, if you have written anything related to finance on your resume prepare it very well they will grill a lot and have some basic market idea and news.
For HR rounds, prepare from the company site about how they do business, what they offer you and your work.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
First thing would be talk to as many seniors as you can and learn about different profiles and their interview process. It helped me a lot to prepare for the companies before hand.
Do practice coding very well and stick to only one platform and try to complete it. Programming club archives can be a good source as it gives some test type experience as well. Even if you are preparing for a analyst or finance profile coding is must as many quant companies take coding technical test for shortlisting.
Complete all the probability problems from brainstellar and you could also watch the TedEd riddles sometimes they are asked directly in interviews and are tough to think instantaneously. 
Prepare your resume very well and write down everything that could be asked and don't lie about any point on your resume and have your resume verify by as many seniors you can it really helps.
Also get insights about the company you are interviewing as it reflects your enthu for joining the company.
