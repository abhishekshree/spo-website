In Goldman Sachs, there were questions related to probability and stats, puzzles 
In Google, Uber, Sprinklr only coding questions were asked in all the rounds
In Optiver, questions related to CS fundamentals are also asked apart from quant and coding questions.

Other insights on the interview process - 
1. Think out loud. Interviewer wants to see your approach so you should keep explaining your thought process.
2. Communicate well (very important to ace an interview).
3. Try to catch the hints that the interviewers give. Usually when you are going in the wrong direction or taking a long time to reach to the solution, interviewers give you hints.
4. If you think you are taking a lot of time, then ask the interviewer to guide you.
5. Try to think of corner cases and build upon any cases that the interviewers tell.
6. Practice the standard questions that can be asked related to any topic well.
7. Lastly, do not panic. Keep calm and keep smiling :)

3. Talk to a lot of seniors about the internship preparation and keep in contact with them.
