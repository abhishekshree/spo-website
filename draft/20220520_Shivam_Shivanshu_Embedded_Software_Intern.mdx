## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Resources for Coding : 
Interview Bit, LeetCode and GeeksForGeeks for Data Structure and Algorithms and Codeforces for general problem solving

Resources for Quant profiles and Aptitude :
50 Challenging Problem in Probability, Brainstellar and Puzzles from geeksforgeeks, lecture slides for MSO201A

Resources for Core based Profile :

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
The first round for Texas Instrument Software role was a resume based round. I was asked question based on my resume and past projects that I did in my first and second years. I had a project on Image Processing and Deep Learning. Most questions were based on working of Neural Network and Image Processing. It is important that one should be able to defend points on the resume. Revising the concepts used in any past projects will be useful.

Second round was mostly technical round. For embedded software role, solid foundation of C language is highly recommended. I was asked question on pointer arithmetic, bit manipulation, coding questions in C. There were few question on memory management and allocation in C. Revision of programming concepts in C from ESC101 and geeksforgeeks is recommended. 

Besides, It is recommended to practice questions from sites like Interview Bit and Leetcode, often questions are modification of some standard problem, so practicing similar problem will help in actual interview process.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Early Bird catches the prey. I would recommend to decide the types of role that you find are best suited for your interest as early as possible then plan accordingly, start practicing from resources that you think might be useful in your preparations. If you feel lost contact any senior or friends. Don't get dishearten if you feel lost, it gets easier everyday, the hard part is doing it everyday :)
