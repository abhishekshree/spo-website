## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
I was previously shortlisted for an interview with AB InBev for the data analytics profile

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
I was focusing on Techno-managerial, data science, software and core roles in the same order of preference and hence the preperation level decreased in the same order xD
I majorly practiced through LeetCode and Codeforces contests to improve CP and did DSA practice from GfG and LeetCode. For data science, I brushed up on the basics of ML from the Andrew NG course notes on Coursera.
For Technomanagerial, I practiced a lot of GDs because that is where I felt I was quite weak. I also familiarized myself with some product supply terms like B2B (business to business), 3P (3rd party), etc.
Coming to core, I did not revise my courses much (ironic!) because I knew my low CPI wouldn't lead to any good shortlists in the core profile. However, before Dr. Reddy's technical interview, I revised ESO201 (thermodynamics), basics of engines (dunno why) and mass transfer specifics. In the technical test for mechanical students in Dr. Reddy's, there were questions form ESO202 (MOS), Manufacturing and ESO201 (thermodynamics) of course.
That is all for my preparation, which in fact was very random and all over the place :)

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
AB InBev
Technical Test: It comprised of 3 sections, the first one contained the basic CAT DILR type questions, the next section contained CS basics like polymorphism, and yada yada yada (dunno much about it xD) and last section contained 2 coding questions (CP types).
Group Discussion: The topic for our GD was "The preception of Beer in India and what can we do to improve it" It was during the GD that I found out that AB InBev was a company associated with beer (smh) So always do your research and company background check beforehand. The GD went quite well in my opinion.
Interview: It was a very weird interview because they kept switching between technical and HR questions. So, prepare HR questions well in advance (why you want to join AB InBev etc)
They asked me about the correlation between mechanical engineering and data science, which I could not answer at all. If your major and your interests differ, you can expect such questions, again, prepare well in advance. They also asked me about the ways in which the Indian Govt. can use the machine learning project that I had done. All in all, I would say that they were checking how clear I was about my interests, how serious I was in pursuing them.
I was very nervous and underconfident throughout. I was not selected for the internship. (sed)
Dr. Reddy's
Technical Test: There were analytical questions (CAT DILR types) and core questions based on simple thermodynamics and MOS.
Group Discussion: The GD was very technical, unlike the GDs that I had practiced. So, for such a GD, think and structure your points carfully to avoid any loopholes. The topic given may look complicated but the arguments were based on very simple scientific principles (for ex, surface area, laws of thermodynamics, etc.)
Coming to the technical interview: The interviewee was a PhD in molecular science or something (a very high profile senior xD) He started with my introduction and then asked me about why would I, a mechanical engineer, be interested in joining a pharma company. So, do research about the company, about their domain before the interview. Then he quizzed me on my resume and focussed soley on my SURGE project which included a lot of simulations using LAMMPS and OVITO. He then asked me how such simulations can be used in a pharma company. So, you much be very clear on your projects, anything and everything you write on your resume and it's practical applications as well. He then asked me a bit about the robotics experience I had and asked a couple of questions based on the robotics project I had done. He then asked me why I wanted to join Dr. Reddy's to which I replied with enthusiasm about their great work culture, the various opportunities one gets to work on, etc. Prepare such HR questions from before so that you appear confident in your interviews.
Next was the HR round: It took place after around 15 mins of the technical round. I was not prepared at all. It started off by my introduction, where I come from and what I liked the most about Odisha (my homeland and birthplace <3) He then asked me why I had such a low CPI to which I replied logically. I even exclaimed how I am working hard to improve on it. He then asked me how much does CPI matter to which I replied, it matters a lot but there are other factors to consider than just CPI and here he exclaimed to me that CPI is the most improtant point in your resume and everything else is secondary. I was totally flustered at this point. He even exclaimed "I don't know what your seniors told you, but CPI is the most important thing" I quickly backed up my points "Yes, CPI is important, but a low CPI does not mean the end of the world" and likewise. He then thanked me for my time and the HR round was over. Do prepare such questions before hand. I think the only thing they check in the HR round is how confident you are, how good you will be for working in a team, that's all. So be confident, be cool and be calm.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Have faith in yourself and be well prepared. SPO internship drive is a very random process in my opinion. You may be a really good match for a company and yet get rejected, so do not fret much about it. Keep going with the preparation. Be patient, not everything needs to happen on Day 1 or Day 2. Your ultimate goal is to secure an internship and that is what matters the most.
Another important thing, do talk to seniors, not just about preparation, but also about any fears or doubt or anxiety you might be facing, they understand all these things and are there to listen to you. Keep in touch with your friends, no one can cheer you up the way they can, it really gives a boost to your confidence.
It will all work out in the end for sure.
All the best :)
