## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
N.A.

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
InterviewBit, Geeksforgeeks, 50 challenging problems in probability

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Initial rounds tested your reflexes, speed and short term memory by simple games. There were also puzzles and questions on series. You can also practice questions on analogy. 
GD mainly consisted of 'Making the Market' which needed good estimation skills. So, read random facts like GDPs and area of countries to have atleast very rough estimate. Also, keep in touch with prices of gold, silver and conversion rates.
Interviews were heavily based on probability questions. 50 Challenging Problems will come in handy. Read the notes of MSO/CS202 as well. Making the market was again used. So keep reading those facts.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Be confident with your work and keep your basics clean. For coding tests, do go through through old problems from InterviewBit and read reviews at glasssdoor. Plan your work atleast a month in advance so you can cover all the topics before the tests start. You might have many bad tests along with a few good ones, but don't feel down as it happens with everyone.
