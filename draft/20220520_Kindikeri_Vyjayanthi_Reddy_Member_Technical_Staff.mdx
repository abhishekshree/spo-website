## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Interviewbit , LeetCode , Gfg(helped me to know multiple methods for some standard ques) .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqowUJzG-iM&list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go(For  DP),
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTtpfjGlH2M&list=PLgUwDviBIf0rGEWe64KWas0Nryn7SCRWw(For graphs)
 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
I had two rounds of interview ,around 30 min each. In the first round, I was asked DSA-few conceptual questions, and also was given a coding question (first I explained my approach then was asked to write code in word doc& finally discussed it's time &space complexity).In the next round , MSO201 &ESC201(my 4th sem courses) and DSA ,also few HR kinda questions.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Maintain decent CPI. Practicing DP and graphs is must if you aim for software profiles and while practicing ,though you've seen some solution ,do write the code by yourself .It brings confidence and gives you more clarity .Interviewbit is one of best sources as it covers ques of various categories . Don't leave white spaces in your resume. Do some project(related to profile you're interested in) /internship in your second year summer. Be well prepared of each and every point you put on your resume(every course ,project,skills).Approach your seniors for any kind of doubts/guidance
