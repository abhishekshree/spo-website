## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
nan

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Interviewbit, geeksforgeeks, codeforces, atcoder

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
It was mostly based on my resume which included questions about my projects, where did I used the coding languages which I had mentioned and about some other skills that I had.
I was asked only one question in coding and that was on the topic arrays.
After that rest were HR questions in which some questions were hypothetical situation based questions, some were about me and some were about AmEx.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
I was particularly preparing for the SDE role so I will tell you about the same. Practice as much problems as you can. Leetcode and interviewbit are two really nice platforms for the same. If you are starting your preparation very early and you have ample amount of time then you can go for leetcode. It has a lot of questions which have already been asked in company tests aur interviews. But if you are starting your preparation at a time when you have some other work also and cannot give more than 1-2 months for coding then go for interviewbit because it has relatively less questions than leetcode but it will atleast ensure that you are done with all the topics by practicing some questions from each topics. Also if you are starting earlier then you can do codeforces as well apart from leetcode because doing codeforces increases your speed and logical thinking. 
Apart from this do some good projects and prepare them well and also don't write anything that you have not done yourself in your resume.
Last but not the least, maintain a good CPI because it also matters a lot.
Besides all the above things, keep working hard and believe in yourself. You are going to excel in whatever you want to do.
Good luck!
