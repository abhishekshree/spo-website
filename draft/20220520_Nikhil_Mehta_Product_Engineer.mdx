## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
If someone has practised enough Competitive Programming, then one should not worry about the interview questions asked by sprinklr.
Binary Search Trees is the most important topic for sprinklr.
Their were two technical rounds and one cultural fitment round by HR.
Questions asked in technical interviews were:
1) Merge K binary search trees and return an array.
2) Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-consecutive-subsequence/)
3) Basic OOP Concepts.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
I started practising competitive programming a bit late and would recommend everyone to start at least 2 months before the tests begin. Having two good projects or one intern and a good project definitely gives you an edge over others.
Be calm in interviews as the interviewer does not only want you to solve the question, he/she wants it to solve with you.
