## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
AlphaGrep Quant and Software, Optiver Quant and Software, Google, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, DE Shaw

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Mostly I did competitive programming from codeforces. Apart from that, I also completed Interviewbit and also solved some standard questions on leetcode. For the quant, I read 50 challenging problems for probability and brainstellar for puzzles.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
For the quant roles questions asked are mostly variants of the standard questions in 50 challenging problems or brainstellar. So doing them helps a lot. Apart from that, most companies focus on Data Structures and Algorithms, so knowledge of all standard algorithms is highly recommended. Some also ask questions on Object Oriented Programming (Particularly DE Shaw). The questions also revolved around projects in Goldman Sachs. The selection tests also revolved around three main things- DSA problems, Probability and Stats and some OOPs concepts. 
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
As I mentioned earlier, the most important topics for software development and quant roles are data structure and algorithms and probability and statistics. So focus on competitive programming on various online judges - that should get you started with developing problem solving abilities. Also the questions asked in interviews are of standard nature, so sites like GeeksforGeeks are a must read. For quant roles, the resources are pretty much the same - Brainstellar , 50 challenging problems in Probability, Gurmeet's blog. Most importantly, believe in yourself, specially during the internship drive, because it is easy to lose confidence when you don't see yourself in company's shortlists. Just give your best, and believe in yourself.
