## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
None

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
I started my preparation around June(though I would recommend you to start early). I mainly used GFG and Leetcode for DSA preparation and practice. For quant preparation, I referred to MSO203 notes and practiced puzzles from GFG and brainstellar.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
There were basically two rounds. Since I was interviewed for an analyst profile, the interview process mainly revolved around the DL/ML projects which I had in my resume. I was also asked some puzzles, case studies and guesstimates and also some questions about the company.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
My advice would be to start your preparation as early as possible, have good projects in your resume, related to the profile you are targeting if possible. Also get your resumes reviewed by the seniors.
Try upsolving the questions which you were unable to solve in the previous tests. You get to learn a lot from those.
For interviews, I would advice you to be thorough with each and every point written in your resume. Some companies like Amex asks many questions about the company so make sure you are prepared for those. And lastly don't panic if you don't know the answer. The interviewers are usually understanding. You can always ask for hints as they are there to test your abilities and the approach you use to reach to the final answer. 
And most importantly, stay in touch with your friends, It helps :)
