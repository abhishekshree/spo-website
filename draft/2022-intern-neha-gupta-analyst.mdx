## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Goldman Sachs(Analyst), Uber(Software), Nomura(Analyst)

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
For coding, I practiced on interview bit platform and referred to GFG for the theory. To get a basic understanding of DP, I watched Aditya Sharma's you tube videos (although they are in Hindi but trust me if you aren't getting anything in DP and feeling frustrated, then certainly it will help). 
For puzzles, I did 50 challenging problems in probability, Brainstellar, Gurmeet's puzzles, Heard on the Street and puzzles given at interview bit and GFG. Many problems are repeated at these different platforms, you will be able to do 90% of the puzzles by thoroughly going through the first 2 resources. 
For aptitude, I did some CAT papers (quant section) and some papers from Pariksha website .
For probability and statistics, I had already done HSO201 in my 4th semester, so I just revised my notes. 
For guesstimates, I had gone through "IITB case interviews cracked" book. Cases aren't generally asked in interns, and if they are then as such no preparation is required for them, you can easily do them by presence of mind.
For ML and data science, I had done the Andrew Ng course at coursera and also gone through the stuff given at GFG, towards data science website and some other websites, randomly exploring the articles and blogs. 


## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
I just had 1 round in GS, in which mostly questions were about my projects in my resume and 3 puzzles from brainstellar. I wasn't able to answer 2 of them, so wasn't able to go to further rounds. 
Had 3 rounds in Nomura . In the first round they almost asked  everything. Starting with projects, I was asked to explain briefly about 3 out of 4 projects listed on my resume. They didn't cross-question much or dived deeply into them but just wanted an overview of what I had done. Then few puzzles and coding questions were asked which were very very easy. Also, they expected them to be answered fast but at the same time explain your approach very clearly. Then they asked few economics related questions (mainly macroeconomics) as my branch was economics. Also, it's much better if you know derivatives to have a engaging discussion with them (I didn't know about them). Then they asked a common guesstimate that how many people are there above Delhi (in air) at present. 
Second round revolved mainly about macroeconomic questions and third was HR round, which was quite chill.
In Amex, in which I finally got selected, I had 2 rounds. In the first round, first of all they asked about exploration I had done about Amex, like what does it actually do, how it earns the revenue and its business model. Then they dived into my projects, mainly 2 ML related projects that were on my resume, followed by a lot of cross-questions about ML related stuff and statistics based questions. One of the question asked was to state 10 assumptions of linear regression (I knew only 5 of them :/ ).  Then few puzzles were asked which were fairly easy. Then a guesstimate was asked which was a direct question from "IITB case interviews cracked" book, so I was able to give quite nice number. 
The second round was technical + HR round. In that too, resume related questions, HR questions and 2 cases were asked. Cases weren't that difficult, I was just expected to analyze the parameters on which the case can be assessed. 


## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Except for core and finance profiles, coding is necessary for every other profile. So, its better to start it ASAP and also practice it on a regular basis. Aptitude tests are there in almost all companies, so practice them until you are confident about it. These two things will mainly determine the shortlist except CPI (which you can't work on at the last moment). For interviews, you should know each and every bit of your resume by heart. Apart from that puzzles also need to be at least done once thoroughly. Other things are profile as well as company dependent. It's highly advised to talk to some senior who had interned with the company few days before the interview so that you can work on your loopholes, if any.
 At the last, I would say just keep yourself calm and compose throughout the process, don't panic or underestimate yourself if you can't make it up on day1 or day2. Keep trying until you grab it and trust me you will surely get what you deserve. All the very best !!
