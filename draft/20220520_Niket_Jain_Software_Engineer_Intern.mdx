## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Interviewed for Optiver - Quant,  Quadeye - Quant, Microsoft - Software Engineer, Nomura - Global Market Algos and Adobe - Research Intern while selected for Amazon - Software Engineer and Oracle - Member Technical Staff

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
For software engineer roles, I starting practising on interviewbit (Programming track) from around May. In addition to that, I used to practice problems on codeforces and codechef regularly since the beginning of the year (3rd semester). For data structures and algorithms, I revised the concepts of ESO207, and also looked for new and difficult topics on GeeksForGeeks. I practised MCQs based on DBMS and Operating Systems on GeeksForGeeks, and revised basic concepts in these topics based on these MCQs. For quant profiles, I practiced logical reasoning and probability questions on brainstellar and "50 challenging problems in probability". For probability, I also revised the concepts of CS203 course. (MSO201 would be better if you had).

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Practice problems on dynamic programming, recursions, data structures (graphs, trees, stacks, queues) and strings properly as most of the questions were based on these. A lot of companies asked questions based on DFS and BFS algorithms for graphs. 
Some companies also asked MCQs based on DBMS, Operating systems and Networking, 
For quant based roles, apart from coding, questions were asked based on logical and verbal reasoning, probability (expected values, random variables are very important). Questions on mental maths were also asked (like finding square roots mentally).
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Start preparing early(probably by the end of 3rd semester), and know well about your projects. Try solving the problems on paper first before coding a solution, as it helps very much during interviews, where code is to be written from scratch. Try to give mock interviews with your friends, and your seniors. Try to consult seniors who were selected for the same profiles/companies as you are interested in.
