## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Goldman Sachs, Nomura

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
For Coding - Codeforces, Leetcode
For Quant - CS203 notes, Xinfeng Zhou, Brainstellar 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
GS:- Mostly questions on probability, they were similar to those of Brainstellar. One easy coding question involving prefix and suffix arrays. Some discussion on resume.

Nomura:- A simple question based on recurrent expectation, a hard chess-based puzzle, a hard CP-type question, some discussion on resume.

Wells Fargo:- Lots of discussion on resume, two coding questions (one was based on DP, the other was simple observation), lots of questions on DS/Algo (some examples- give some practical uses of priority queues and trees, why do we need the concept of cycles in graphs, what is your favorite algorithm and why).

Some general insights:- 
1. Don't get nervous. It's easier said than done, I know, but I can't stress it enough. 
2. Be confident. I was rejected in GS despite answering all of the questions correctly because the interviewer thought I looked too lethargic (in reality I was just under-confident). 
3.Practicing mock interviews with your friends/family might help. 
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Begin your preparation as early as you can, especially if you're aiming for Software roles. Do a lot of Leetcode (Medium and Hard) and keep giving contests on Codeforces. For quant, go through MSO/HSO/CS203 notes, complete the book 50 Challenging problems and the puzzle and probability sections of Xinfeng Zhou, and go through all the questions on Brainstellar.
