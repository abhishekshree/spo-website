## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
None

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
My primary targets were Quant and Finance Roles. I think 50 Challenging Problems and Brainstellar are enough for that. Apart from that, there are other sites available as well, but these 2 cover most of the problems which are asked in Interviews.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
There was an initial resume shortlist where 60 students were selected, followed by a GD in groups of 5 or 6. 12 students were shortlisted for interviews.
My interview was largely based on my Resume and a few puzzles in between. I had 3 interviews including 1 HR round. First Interview went smoothly. I was grilled on the projects that I had mentioned in my Resume- these included a Finance project and another was an Economics HSO course project. Since I had done a Macroeconomics course as well, I was asked some Macroeconomics questions. I think one should be very careful while writing anything in their resume. The interviewers can ask you anything from the courses you have mentioned as well, if they feel the courses are relevant to the job profile.
In the second round, again there was a detailed discussion on my projects followed by a lot of questions on Macroeconomics again. I was probably able to answer around just more than half of those questions. At one point, It was like a rapid fire, where questions were being thrown every second. They try to see your breaking point, that do you panic when you dont know the answer, or do you crack when you are under a lot of pressure . I also think that it is better to tell them straightaway that you dont know the answer to a question than try to give some answer that you are not very sure about, not knowing the answer is perfectly fine and they dont mind it as well. A puzzle was also asked in this round.
The HR round was just a formality where I was asked some question like "Why did you take Economics at IIT ?" and few questions about me and my family.
All in all, you should be very very thorough about anything you have mentioned in your resume, and you should be good in solving puzzles. Needless to say, communication skills matter a lot in these interviews and you should be confident while speaking in front of the interviewers. 
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Try doing some summer projects or internships for companies which have resume shortlists. 1 really good project can get your resume shortlisted in most of the companies. And dont take up a project just for the sake of it, dive deep and understand every aspect of it.
I think its better to target specific profiles than just applying for every company that comes for the internship season. I know Non CEM branches dont have a lot of choices, but I think this really helps you focus on what you want to do and ultimately makes you prepare well for these specific roles.
Do talk to seniors who have interned at the company for which you are interviewing. It gives you some insight about the interview and what to expect in the interview.
Realize that luck is also an important factor in this Internship Season, but hardwork is the most important. If you have worked hard, you might get an Internship or you might not, but if you havent worked, then it is sure that you wont get one. Consistent efforts are what matter in the end. So dont give up, keep working, keep pushing.
ALL THE BEST!
