## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
American Express (Analytics), Wells Fargo, Qualcomm (Core), Dr. Reddy’s (Analytics)

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
I prepared only for non-core profiles (software, quant, analytics). For software profile, DSA theory, OOPs concepts, good command over C++, Python, or Java, CP practice, OS & DBMS concepts are required. For Quant profile, DSA theory, good command over one of C++, Python, or Java,  OOPs concepts, Strong maths (which includes Probability and Statistics, Linear algebra, and a little bit of real analysis). For Analytics,  good command over Python is preferred (C++ & Java might work, company-specific), Machine learning concepts, Data science concepts, and basic analytical maths.

I used Geeksforgeeks for preparing CPP-STL and OOPs concepts. Programiz is also a well-structured source for DSA concepts. However, it is better to follow ESO207A course notes for preparing for the DSA theory component. I also completed InterviewBit, since it is nicely structured and contains all the important coding questions for the interviews. LeetCode can also be used. However, I advise sticking to one of these two platforms and completing them fully. Preparation for Competitive Programming should start at least after the endsem of the 4th semester. Delaying in practicing CP can be disastrous. Codeforces and CodeChef can be used for preparing CP in time-bound format. I did not prepare for OS & DBMS concepts because I was unaware of their importance; however, a non-CSE student should prepare basic concepts since they are asked in almost all SDE tests. 

For Probability and Statistics, one can follow the MSO201A course, which is compulsory in some branches (EE, MTH). Otherwise, there are two open courses available on the site of Penn State University. These courses are the best source to follow for Probability theory (link: Probability) and statistics (link: Statistics). For preparing puzzles, “50 most challenging problems in probability by Friedrich Mosteller” and Brainstellar can be followed. I did all the questions from both sources combined, and that was enough. 

Top 50 or 100 questions for each can be found on InterviewBit for almost every basic skill. So one can go through those questions for fast revision. Machine learning concepts can be learned from the Andrew NG course on Coursera. That is more than enough. Basic analytical maths contains questions based on work-time problems, speed-distance problems, and basic PnC. Prepare competitive programming very well, because only through coding you can get shortlisted for the interviews. Interviews are normally easier than coding tests.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Prepare the Resume at least two weeks before the submission deadline. Read the resume 5-7 times before final submission. Know your resume very well, and avoid mentioning all the information or skill you cannot re-produce in the interviews. Making a simple resume with focused and crisp facts is desirable. Education, Achievements, Skills, Work experience, Position of responsibility, Projects are some of the basic headings for a resume. If you have a publication, make two resumes, one with publication and the other without it, because mentioning publications might not attract some companies. Prepare introduction well. Tell the interviewer everything about you and your work experience, along with your interests and organization affiliations.

Visa conducted a coding round for shortlisting candidates for the interviews. It was a 1-hour test with 2 programming questions. One of the questions was based on Knapsack 0/1 concept, and the other one I don’t remember. My experience with the Visa interview was pretty smooth. The interview started with the interviewer giving an unexpectedly long introduction. Then he asked me my introduction. Then he started asking basic coding questions, such as print all the repeating characters from a string, print odd numbers from an array, and reverse binary calculation. Then he asked me questions about OOPs concepts. Then he asked me HR questions, which I answered with confidence. Then the interview ended. He asked if I had any questions, where I asked questions regarding the data security management at Visa. Always try to ask interesting questions if the interviewer asks for them. 


## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Start preparation early, so that you get selected at the earliest. The internship season can be very tough for some people, who do not get selected on Day 1. Be positive, even if you get rejected many times, and improve bit by bit. Anyone can ping me on Facebook for any advice. I am sure that you will definitely get a good internship :)
