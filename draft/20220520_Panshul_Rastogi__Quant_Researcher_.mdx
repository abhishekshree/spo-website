## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Optiver- Trading profile (elimination in interview round), Nomura (elimination in GD) 

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Coding practice from Interview Bit and YouTube Video lectures of Aditya Verma to understand concepts. 
Puzzles - BrainStellar website, Book of 50 challenging Problems in Probability and Heard on the Street 
ZedStatistics, Ritvik Maths YouTube videos for  Statistics and Time Series concepts which were useful for Quant Role. 
Finance Resources - Citibank Finance guide available on SPO portal under Finance tab. 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
As the profile which I got selected for is Quant, the technical round was heavily focused around Probability and Statistics. Asked the reasoning behind 3 puzzles, a similar version of them was already available on Brainstellar/50CP. I had a project on Pairs Trading strategy which included Time Series concept, so the interviewer jumped straight to that (Cointegration, Stationary time series, mathematical reasoning behind what I did in the project). This took up most of the time. As I was from Economics & had Finance stuff on my resume, they asked me to explain Options contract, Impact on Indian economy during Covid etc.
Next round was HR round (lasted 20-25 min)
Usually people ignore this and go unprepared. I suggest to spend atleast a day collecting your thoughts on Why you, Why this profile, Why this company, Your strengths/weakness and other such standard questions. This, according to me is the Make or Break round. This round has the potential to showcase you in whatever light you want to be portrayed. Try to build a story around your past incidents & achievementa which should indicate how you are naturally fit for this role. 
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Higher the CGPA, better your chances.
For those targeting Quant/Finance/Analytics profile: Try to build your profile by undertaking projects under SnT clubs, professors, and internships by reaching out to seniors & people on LinkedIn.
You can start practicing Puzzles a month or 45 days prior to Day 1.  
For coding, InterviewBit and YouTube video lectures would suffice and atleast 2-3 months practice is recommended. 
Start preparing your resume early. Your first draft should be ready around 1 month prior and circulate it amongst seniors. Talk to seniors about their interview, test process and preparation methodology they followed. This helps a great deal. 
All the best!
