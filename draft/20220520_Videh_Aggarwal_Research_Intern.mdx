## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
HUL interview:
They started with my introduction. I said im interested in EV's. So they asked:
a) Difference between industrial motor and electric vehicle induction motor.
After this they went on to concepts of eso203, but majorly ee330 which I hadn't read. I remember the last question they asked me:
b) do we get single phase or three phase power at home?

Adobe interview:
I was asked only 2 questions after my introduction.
a) find 2nd min element from an array. I suggested an O(n) single pass solution.
b) a variation of knapsack. A robber has a box of dimensions w×l×H. He steals gold bars of different denominations of dimensions w×l×h, where h varies for each goldbar. Suggest an algorithm to the robber. This is a knapsack algorithm.

Texas instruments Interview:
I had 2 interviews. In both of them I was first asked about basic concepts of EE200 related to fourier transforms, convolution operations (especially graphical method of convolution), and general functions like the step and delta functions.
After this, I was asked probability and strategy puzzles. One which I remember is:
a) There are 50 coins of different denominations in a line in front of you. You are playing a game with an opponent where you start first and always pick a coin from one of the ends. Then your opponent continues and it alternates such that there are no coins left. The person with maximum value of coins wins. Tell if you can win and if yes, suggest a strategy.
Soln: Find the sum of coins in even and odd places. Start picking coins which belong to the  larger group. You are assured of victory.

b) what is the probability of a 2 cm diameter coin to land completely inside a white square, when tossed, in a standard chessboard of side length 80 cm.
Hint: find the area where the centre of the circle can lie.

c) you and your friend are given a hat at random- it could be blue or red. Without talking to each other, you and your friend have to guess the colour of the hats on your heads, simultaneously. You guys win if any one of you can guess your hat colour correctly. You can discuss your strategy beforehand. What should it be and what is the probability of you winning the game? You can see your friend's hat but not yours. Vice versa is also true.

Ans: You should always guess the colour of your friend's hat and your friend should always guess opposite of the colour of your hat. This guarantees a 100% chance of winning.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Before the internship tests:
Focus on coding. It is v v v imp. The next thing to give priority to are probability questions and puzzles. But coding should get no. 1 priority.

During the tests:
Dont feel demotivated when your friends are getting an intern and you r not. A considerable amount of luck is also involved. Just try your best in all tests because you have nothing to lose. Even if you don't get an on-campus internship, you can try for off-campus ones.
