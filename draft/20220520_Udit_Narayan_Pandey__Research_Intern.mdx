## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Adobe was the first interview

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
None, I was doing research work in summers.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
For me, my interview was sort of trivial. Alloted time was 30 minutes, my interview finished in 20 minutes only. Interviewer asked 2 very simple questions of Linear Algebra and one easy question to calculate expectation. Then asked a project I am proud of doing, I told one and then the interview was over.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Do not fool yourselves,  have solid basics, do not indulge in cheating even in this online semester, cause that would not gain you any knowledge, and it is knowledge that ultimately matters.
