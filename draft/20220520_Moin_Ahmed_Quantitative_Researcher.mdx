## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Nomura - Algo Strategies, Qualcomm - Interim intern

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
InterviewBit, CSES, Leetcode, Brainstellar, 50 challenging problems in probability, Practical Guide to Quantitative interviews

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Programming - Dynamic programming, Graph Algo, Trees, OOP
Probability & statistics - Puzzles, general prob-stats (Covariance, linear regression, Normal distribution, Significant testing, etc.)
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Try to keep a balanced profile, rather than focusing just on Data Science or Core, this would increase your chances of getting placed early; DSA, Probability and Statistics, Finance are a must. 
The main problem that many of you will face is not getting shortlisted on day1 companies because of the OAs, so make sure you start early with Competitive programming/Time-bound problem-solving.
The nature of the job is changing, our season was tougher than the ones before, yours will be even harder.
