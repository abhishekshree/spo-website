## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Optiver- Quant , Amazon India- SWE, Wells Fargo- SWE, Kla Tencor - SWE

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Leetcode, Gfg puzzles, Eso 207 lectures by Prof. Anil Seth

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
The questions which were asked through all the interviews were mostly based on two pointer problems in arrays, KMP and Z pattern matching algorithms, DFS, sorting, process scheduling ,searching connected regions inside a grid, some standard puzzles
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Start competitive programming early, as it takes a while to get accustomed to it, and achieve the required speed, accuracy and thinking. I started coding on leetcode platform from july first week and did only about 150 problems, while most of my friends started early and had done more than 300 problems on leetcode or various platforms. Also, I did not participate in coding contests, and because of this, I did not perform well in the tests of most day 1 companies. But I got better during the process itself. But it was a very careless and risky approach, that's why i recommend start doing cp contests in early 4th semester, so you get a hang of it early. After that, the targeted practice for tests should be started around late may or early june. It would give you a boost and you should be able to get shortlisted for multiple day 1 companies. 
For the interviews, luck plays a very important role, so prepare your best and don't lose hope along the way. I got rejected at 4 interviews. Among them, I reached the final round for kla tencor and both the rounds went pretty smooth, still I wasn't selected for the company, and it affected my confidence a lot. So, try to do your best and don't lose hope along the process.
