## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
There were 2 rounds of  interviews at Amex , both were a mix of HR and technical , 40 min each  . I got shortlisted for the analytics profile. The first round was a resume based round , we discussed in depth about my intern  and  projects followed by 2 guesstimates  . Few cross questions were - from where have u collected the data , explain the models that you have used .One of the guesstimates was based on my intern ( prev intern ) and one was a general one . Ex- how will you decide who should our target customers if Amex wants to launch its new premium credit card . 
Next round was a business case  followed by some more resume questions .


## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Before any interview or test , talk to the seniors who got selected in the company , this would give you the right direction to prepare for your upcoming tests and interviews . Also before an interview , do research about the company , this would definitely give you an edge over others .  In my opinion , have a rough idea of the profiles you are targeting , but don't be very specific. Coding , Probability , Puzzles are common for all profiles ( majorly ) 
All the best guys !! Feel free to reach out to me .
