Company specific shortlisting:
HFTs software - (Highly) biased towards high CPI. Some don't even conduct tests. Tests are of moderate difficulty.
Rubrik - Shortlisting purely based on coding test. Quality of questions is really good. You should be comfortable with solving A/B/C/D problems in a CF Div 2 round.
Google - Resume shortlisting + test. Do participate in Kickstart/Codejam. If you secure good ranks in them, mention them on your resume as it is a big plus.

Interviews:
HFTs software - Besides DSA, they might expect some knowlege of OOP preferably in C++.
Rubrik - Similar to test just in a different format.
Google - Tricky DSA problems. Also you need to code in a google doc.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Try to maintain a good CPI. Also start preparation early.
