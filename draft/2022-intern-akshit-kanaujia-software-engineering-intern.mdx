## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Intuit India, Razorpay, Citrix. (software engineering in all of them) 

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
I have used GeeksforGeeks, Interview Bit , and sometimes leetcode for practicing typical Coding Questions, but in my opinion you just have to stick to anyone of them that would be sufficient. And continuously did competitive programming on codeforces and codechef.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
In the first online round i was asked 2 question out of them 1 is of DP, and 1 is of graphs. And in the interview round i was asked about 2 question on  DP , 1 question of backtracking, and 1 question on strings. 

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
So the one advice which I get from everyone is to just keep calm and be confident on your preparation , since I did not get intern on day 1 and failed 3 interviews all I did is to stay calm and believe my preparation and  yeah I got selected in my 4th attempt , So if you stay calm and be confident, you will definitely get good results.
