## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
American Express- Analytics,  Edelweiss-Quant Intern

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
website Interviewbit- Coding , website Brainstellar- puzzles , book fifty challenging problems-probability 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Honestly I didn't prepare for core job but i got shortlisted in signal processing role also with software role. About those signal processing interviews i can say that you should have good knowledge of ee200 along with mso201 to clear them.
About embedded software profile you should have good practice of coding but they didn't ask complex algorithms and complex topics like graph and dynamic programming. 
questions that were asked in my interviews were mostly on bit-manipulation , medium 2d array problems and some easy stack and queue problems apart from this they ask problems on pointers similar to esc101 quizzes.
I didn't have much experience in embedded programming and also didn't have any project in that domain but after seeing machine learning and image processing projects on my resume they start asking machine learning question like what is activation function or what is backpropagation , what is significance of bias value in neural network , he also ask me to write code for data normalization and convolution operation of 3*3 kernel into 10*10 image matrix

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
