## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
APT- Portfolio, Wells Fargo, KLA Tencor, Flipkart, Oracle, Amazon.

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
I used to practice competitive coding from codeforces, but then for interviews I switched to leetcode. GFG is also pretty helpful.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Amazon - Find nearest greater element (used stacks), and a strings related problem involving dfs. 
APT Portfolio -  Puzzles and Probability questions in first round. Then Print a 2D matrix in spiral fashion using recursion. Level order traversal on Binary tree and some OOPS concepts too.
Wells Fargo - First round was just based on your CV and projects.
Flipkart - DP on strings and a simple sliding window question.
Oracle - First round was more of an interaction. In second round they asked me to reverse a linked list (Classic), how memory allocation works in C/C++, Post-order traversal in BT(recursively and iteratively), etc.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Please learn all the basic interview specific stuff. Even if you know how to find lowest common ancestor using binary lifting on a tree, but don't know what level order traversal means, then it's likely that you won't get selected. Learnt that the hard way. Anyways, even if you are tanking every single interview, do not fret. There are a lot of options ahead :)
