## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
None(did not apply for many roles)

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Interviewbit was the only source I used. However I won't recommend it to be that way. Additionally, use Leetcode if specifically preparing for internships. 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Technical Round 1: One question on binary search trees(med-hard)(answered, but couldn't optimize), One question on arrays that used quicksort(hard)(answered)
Technical Round 2: 2 pointers(med)(answered), and one question on algorithm design (hard)(answered) 
HR round: Simplest of all, obviously. They may ask you about the core values of the company, so take a look at it. I wasn't able to answer this one.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Please try to start early! I started only in my summer breaks and was working on a research paper and a project simultaneously. Hence, I was only able to do interviewbit and even that was not thorough. You might get completely unfamiliar questions in the interview if you haven't practiced enough. 
Important: Regularly visit the SPO intern portal. There were instances where I had no idea that some extra forms had to be filled for specific companies. Usually the deadlines are hard, so avoid this.
Cliched, but I would remark not to get too concerned even if you don't make it through. Only later you will realise that opportunities are plenty. But there's nothing to lose in giving a try!
