## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
None

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Kaggle for Machine Learning, Prepleaf for DSA and probability and 50 problems of probability.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Coding round had 3 questions on the concepts of: 1) pre computation 2) backtracking 3) DFS.
Interview round 1 was almost entirely from the resume. To crack it, just be very thorough on each and every point of your resume. A simple DSA question was also asked(for me it was just using loop) 
Round 2 of interview was Techno- HR round. And the key to impress the interviewer is to gain insights from you mentioned experiences of the resume and use them in your answer to solidify it. A bit of vision for the general well being of public in your answers often pays of in the interviews of companies like Amex.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
2-3 main things ,if focused regularly, helps you get an intern pretty much easily via SPO:-
1) Good coding skills and knowledge of DSA.
2) 1 or 2 projects or internships that you have done in coherence with your choice of profile
3) Maintaining a Decent CPI.
Rest you need is patience and perseverance to grab your chance.
