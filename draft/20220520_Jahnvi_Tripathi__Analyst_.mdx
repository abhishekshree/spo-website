## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
P&G (Product Supply) and Goldman Sachs

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
1.)https://brainstellar.com/ and https://www.interviewbit.com/ for puzzles 
2.)https://www.hackerrank.com/ and https://leetcode.com/ for coding 
3.)https://mbapreponline.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fifty_challenging_problems_in__2.pdf for probability. I also referred geeks for geeks for theory. 
4.)https://spo.iitk.ac.in/preparation/ for interview preparation 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
P&G interview mainly had HR and situation-based questions, no puzzles or technical questions.
In Goldman, he asked me if I would prefer software or quant. I chose quant, so he asked me 3 probability questions and 2 puzzles and one of them was the very popular 'ant in a cubical room' puzzle. 
In American Express, the interview started with a basic introduction and 'walk me through your resume.' We discussed my past internship and projects in detail, and then he asked me some company-specific questions and questions to test my knowledge about credit cards. Then there were 5 puzzles, 3 of them directly from brainstellar. 
The second round began with some general HR questions and then some situation-based questions (risk analysis). Then there was an easy probability question. The interview ended with a guesstimate in which I was asked to calculate the total number of private schools in my hometown. 
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
First and foremost, prepare your resume well because it will get you shortlisted and start your preparation as early as possible. Make sure you know everything that you mention in your resume. In my opinion, preparation becomes easier if you have your goal clear in your mind. If you want to go for finance and analytics roles, prepare your resume keeping that in mind. Having relevant projects and internships increases the probability of getting shortlisted. 
Solve as many puzzles as you can because it honestly is a bit difficult to think on the spot under so much pressure. But if you're faced with a problem you have already done before, and if you're able to do it correctly, then it surely will increase your confidence. Think out loud and let the interviewer know how you're proceeding. Stay positive and take your time before you answer. It's totally fine if you take a minute or two to think. It's better than giving a wrong answer in haste or saying a clear no without even giving a thought. 
Try to keep a smiling face and stay confident. You'll nail it!
