## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Rubrik, Google, Optiver, Tower, alphagrep, Uber, Deshaw

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
www.leetcode.com (given most time) www.interviewbit.com www.brainstellar.com www.codeforces.com 
50 challenging puzzles in probability
Also saw CSE Blog by Pratik Poddar

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Google : exact leetcode question (jump game) was asked in first round. I knew the question because of that the question was changed. If you know the question tell the interviewer. I didn't tell. I don't know why I wasn't selected. Maybe because of improper communication

Rubrik : FIrst round: typical dijkstra question, Second Round: union find question. Third round: hr questions. I screwed up in the hr round. Also told the wrong preference as google and rubrik are top 2 preferences.

ALWAYS TELL THE COMPANY THAT THEY ARE YOUR FIRST PREFERENCE.

Tower: They asked puzzled from brainstellar and 50 challenging puzzles in probability

Quadeye: They just asked about academics and gave the offer

Alphagrep: They also asked some queue based questions but I told them I had offer from quadeye and they didn't proceed further.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
ALWAYS TELL THE COMPANY THAT THEY ARE YOUR FIRST PREFERENCE.
