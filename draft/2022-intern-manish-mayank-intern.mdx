## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
None

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Leetcode for DSA problems, "A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews" book by Xinfeng Zhou (for puzzles and aptitude problems), any probability & statistics course (I used MIT OCW). Projects on ML, NLP also helped in the interviews.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
They focused on the entire resume and asked my experience about each of the projects.
Out of three aptitude puzzles in the interview, two were some variants of those in the book by Xinfeng.
They also asked SQL query problems, some conceptual problems from network security, one medium level coding problem from strings. 
In addition to these they gave a practical problem related to databases and queries and asked to discuss how I was going to tackle this, even if the answer was wrong they wanted to see how the student go about thinking of a solution.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Solve leetcode problems, chances are the problems you get in the test are some variants of these problems. Prepare for aptitude problems as well. Theoretical topics like network security, DBMS may give you an advantage. Projects related to data science will also help.
