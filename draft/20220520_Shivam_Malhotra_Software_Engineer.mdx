## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
None

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
I mostly spent my time preparing from InterviewBits and occasionally some CodeForces rounds as they came in live. Also, I believe that GFG and Tushar Roy's Youtube channel are good places to solve doubts in InterviewBits.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
My interview was not exactly algorithmic specific, but it was more on the side of theoretical concepts like the ones taught in ESC101. The rest was related to system design, something I'd say a small mix of web development and DevOps.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
I would only have a simple advice for students, do what you like, because that's the only way you can excel. It does no matter whether everyone is doing ML, if you don't like it, no need to do it, but at the same time must have some knowledge about everything, for people are likely to mistake your disinterest as your unwillingness to learn.
