## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Optiver Quant, Graviton Quant and Software, Microsoft Data Science, Sprinklr 

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
For Quant I used standard resources like Brainstellar, 50 Challenging Problems in Probability, CS203 Course Notes
Apart from this I also used relatively lesser known resources listed below.
Heard on the Street, Max Dama on Automated Trading - Chapter 3, A collection of dice problems, Jane Street monthly puzzles
They didn't exactly help me for Quadeye but are good for general Quant preparation. They did help in the interviews of Jane Street and Optiver.


For software I practiced problems from leetcode, interviewbit and codeforces. 

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
The interviews were mainly focused on Probability and Statistics and involved game theoretic and logical puzzles. Some of the questions were based on market making. 

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Start early. I started preparing seriously only before two weeks of the actual tests and that definitely affected me a lot. My quant was okay but the coding tests require significantly more anount of practice, some HFT companies like Tower and Alphagrep conduct coding tests even for quant profile. I naturally wasn't shortlisted into these and that definitely took a toll on my self confidence. In the end I would say don't stress about the shotlists too much, be confident and have faith in yourselves.
