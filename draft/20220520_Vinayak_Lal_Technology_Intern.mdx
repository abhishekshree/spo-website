## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
No other final shortlists

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Leetcode, Codeforces(competitive Programming), g4g(interview archives,Common Interview Questions), Interviewbit(puzzles), "Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability",I also did a course on Data Science in udemy(Helpful in Analytics profile).

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
In Amex coding round ,3 questions were asked one was greedy type problem(Easy-med), One Grid dfs problem(Medium) and finally Greedy+Grid dfs(Med-Hard) . We had 90 minutes to solve. All three were solvable it mainly tested your implementation skills. The interview I think was slightly different compared to the archives I had read prior to the Interview. It had 2 rounds. In the first round , basic coding questions were asked(Like based on stacks, or to write a pseudo code for binary search algorithm) and some of us were asked to explain our solution to one of the coding round questions. In the second round , the questions were mostly resume based , we were asked to explain the projects . They would ask questions on the implementation details or the final outcome of the project(Basically testing if you had really done your project well).I was also asked a bunch of HR type questions. They would give a hypothetical situation and would ask us how we would react/act in such  a situation or they could also ask about certain moments in your life/career where you showed off these skills in you. Some of us(not me) were also asked some guesstimates but there was no coding questions asked like I had read from the archives. All the shortlisted students had to give both the rounds and selection was based on all three rounds.
In general , common questions you have to prepare for coding rounds are Dynamic Programming(even 2D and 3D), DFS, BFS, Binary Trees, 2 pointer problems, Strings,  Greedy and basic math problems. 
In aptitude rounds you would be asked questions on probability, statistics ,math puzzles, pattern finding,  logic and reasoning questions and for certain roles basic ML/Data Science Questions, SQL mcqs.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
If you are looking to get into a coding profile, I highly suggest competitive programming , People who do CP generally find the questions familiar and can quickly think of an approach to solve the problems, You should go through all the commonly asked topics and interview questions like Sorting Algorithms , Binary Trees , Linked Lists in addition to normal  solving in a platform like Codeforces, Codechef which is more based on logic and problem solving. Solving Problems frequently wont necessarily be useful if you do not have enough contest experience .Many interviews or mcq rounds also frequently display questions based on Object Oriented Programming, It is also important to have a sound knowledge of the time and space complexities of the various algorithms.
For other roles,  you should brush up your probability and statistic skills , Some roles also  needs knowledge of SQL or basic ML .
Preparing for the HR interview is a key factor that may people miss. It is important to show the interviewer that you are committed and your personality is apt for the company. So it is necessary that you convey these qualities of yours to the interviewer and this can be done preparing well for such questions. Prepare what you are going to say about your projects in advance and be confident of yourselves.Keep in touch with your seniors.
