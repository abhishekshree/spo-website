## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Questions were asked about pulse response of RC circuits, followed by cascoded current mirrors, opamp band pass filters, and opamp feedback circuits (especially what the polarity of the opamp is, which transistor gate forms which opamp terminal)
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
No matter how bad the interview is going, don't worry.. you will somehow get it. Keep a resume very relevant to the profile and don't think in the middle of the interview that you have already lost the job. Practice opamp circuits as much as you can. For the written round, simply mug up all previous questions. They change the values only sometimes, and fishing off the old ones will give you more than enough time to work on the new questions in the paper.
