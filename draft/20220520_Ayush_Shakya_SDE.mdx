## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Google (SDE)

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Leetcode (for Practice), InterviewBit, GeeksForGeeks (for algorithms), RankYourBrain (expert level, for initial stages of Optiver)

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
First round was an HR round aimed to make you comfortable with the process and gauge your interest in joining the firm. They aimed to get an idea of your personality and if your vision aligns with that of the company. This was followed by 2 technical rounds. The questions were rather unconventional. The interviewers explained how floating point numbers are stored in IEEE format and then asked me how to add a billion floating numbers (hardware is incapable of doing this). Second technical round revolved all around networking questions (a course I didn't study). Yet he guided me at every step and I was able to answer most of the questions. The interviewers took quite some time in discussing the details and we never really got into writing code.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
You should have a good grasp on CSE core topics (I personally aced my second interview as I had a good idea about floating numbers and difficulties of handling them in hardware). Their programming assessments were relatively easy. Be confident, attentive and communicate throughout the interview. That was the major key even in the technical rounds. Your interviewer might be, say a Frenchman or Puerto Rican, etc. So if you face any difficulty in understanding their accent, let them know (I personally did).
