## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
nan

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
I aimed for SDE, so for that concepts of data structures are the most important. For that the best resources according to me are geeksforgeeks ( I covered(/tried to cover) every article of this - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/?ref=shm ) and Interviewbit questions (must!) .  

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
I was asked about my previous projects first. Then to check DSA skills I was asked to implement a linked list and what were the changes required in the implementation to convert a simple linked list into stack, queue and binary tree.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
If you want an intern on Day 1 , CPI and branch does matter. But later, your skill set will weigh more :) . Aim on building your skill set while maintaining a reasonable CPI. Do self projects if you want to set your own pace, it's great way to learn. Keep talking to seniors of profiles you are interested in.
