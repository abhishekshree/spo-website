## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Samsung Semiconductors - Student Trainee Software

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
Coding/DSA preparation: Codeforces, Interviewbit
Codeforces - A fun way to practice coding questions of all difficulty level, 
Interviewbit - Frequently asked questions of all difficulty level in one place

I had been practising competitive programming questions for over a year without much knowledge in DSA. I never did any formal course (online/offline) on DSA, and never got proper time to do that. I learnt almost everything by solving questions only. I started practising on interviewbit two weeks before the intern season started, mainly because it contains frequently asked problems of every topic with varying difficulty. I tried to cover as many topics as possible. As I had encountered related concepts when I was doing CP, it was relatively less time consuming.

Project: I participated in an externship program that accelerated my learning in Software Development. It was the "Crio Winter of Doing" program. There are are other (maybe better) platforms too (like freeCodeCamp), that allow beginners to learn new technologies in a project based approach. I usually kept looking for these free opportunities all the time.

My most recent project was the deciding factor for my selection. My 2nd interview was solely based on it. The project was and still is significant for me. I knew my project inside out. Every minor details in the project was my own creation, so I had a good understanding about all of them.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Only one programming question was asked in the interviews.
Topics: arrays, sorting, two pointers.

Rest of the things were either CSE concepts or related to my project.
Topics: HTTP request response, client-server model, interface, threading.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Do whatever intrigues you the most/engages you the most. Keep exploring if you haven't found "the right thing". Keep in mind that "the right thing" is just a feeling and there is nothing permanent about it, so don't dwell on it too much. Trying many things will take time so you have to be judicious about how you are using your time. Basically the key is to know the difference between wasting time on something irrelevant and utilising time on something that you love. You should be able to know that with experience.

For example, from the beginning of my 4th semester, I knew what I had to do. My priority was to get more and more experience in the software development field. And I did exactly that.

This part will be relevant to software roles. It may be an unpopular opinion, but I personally feel strongly about this.
Do not rely on just one factor like CPI, or expertise in DSA, or Projects. If you are good in all these you'll probably be selected in the Day 1 companies. If one of the factors is not in your favour being better in the others will definitely pay off. It may take time but it will definitely pay off. At least 2 out of these factors will play a role. Make sure you are confident about any 2.

But, I would seriously NOT recommend sacrificing your CPI for anything else. If somehow you still fail to get a decent CPI, you don't need to worry, those other two factors will definitely help you, you just have to be patient.

I want to clarify what a proper project means. It should not be something trivial or common like a beginner level project, it should include a lot of technologies, it must require you to dive deep and spent a lot of time and effort to understand how it works. The more time you spend and the more effort you put the more skills you gain. These skills are unique to projects only and cannot be gained in any other way. Also, companies sometimes do look for these skills for internship.


I read this on a senior's AnC blog. She wrote: "Luck is directly proportional to hardwork". So work hard, and more importantly have fun, because that's what makes your work meaningful.
