## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Nomura (Global Markets), Sprinklr (Software)

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
* Interviewbit 
* Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews by Xinfeng Zhou
* Brainstellar
* Notes from MSO201(Probability & Statistics), ESO207 (Data Structures & Algorithms), MTH201 (Linear Algebra)

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
*About Adobe Interview*
Adobe's test had 6 sections- Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics, Puzzles, Essay, Coding, Computer Science Basics. After that I was shortlisted for the interview. 

My interview at Adobe was exceptionally chill- almost like a conversation. After the introduction, I was asked to talk about a project I was most proud about (which happened to be a Blockchain project). After that, I was asked if I had done something in the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Finally, I was asked about the most challenging project I had. After this I asked the interviewer a couple of questions and she explained to me her ongoing projects. At the end, she said that she loved the enthusiasm and passion with which I described my projects. (This might be what they are looking for at Adobe, but I am not sure). 

However, a more general interview at Adobe would have a couple of questions on your resume. If you have a ML project or intern, they'll discuss that in great depth. If not, they'll move on to a couple of questions each on Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics and Data Structures Algorithms. 

 *General Suggestions for Interviews*
- be thorough with the projects/internships you have on your resume. Read in detail about the technical skills and domains mentioned. 
- Have an effective introduction prepared (and preferably personalised for the company). In the introduction, drop topics (projects, skills you have, internships you have done) that they will be interested in. This lets you drive your interview towards the topics you are well prepared with. (which is a good thing, since interview time is limited)
- Talk to a senior who has given that company's interview, so that you know what to expect. Most companies follow a similar structure every year.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
* Be selective while applying!-  Don't get distracted by peer pressure (Day 1, Day 2 etc) and stipend (unless you have a financial obligation to fulfill). An intern that comes earlier or an intern that pays more is NOT necessarily a better intern. So, instead talk to seniors/alumni, figure out what the job and company is like and if they fit in with your interests and goals. Thereby, apply to them selectively (of course, balance your risks). It often happens that in the hype to get a Day 1 intern or to get an intern as soon as possible, people end up taking just any intern that they themselves later regret. The process does not allow you to sit for interns once you have got one. So, do not short-sell yourselves!

* Thoroughly practice Data Structures & Algos, irrespective of what you want to get into- The sad truth is that there are handfully few interns which do not ask you to code in their tests. And these are so few, that you cannot depend on them. So irrespective of whatever profile and company you are aiming for, make sure you have practiced coding enough. 

* Don't get demotivated- Your selection is a function of your preparedness, your CPI, your branch and some randomness (aka luck). When you get rejected, stop blaming your CPI, branch and luck (which are all valid justifications but out of your control). Instead keep improving your preparedness with every test & interview you give. And don't get bugged by the massive peer pressure, FB posts and rush of getting an intern asap.  

* Don't shy away texting seniors- Before every test or interview, talk to at least one senior who has given that test/interview. A lot of people miss out on interns because of information asymmetry. Make sure you don't miss out on that!

* Improve your CPI- If you are reading this in time to improve your CPI for the intern season, then I cannot stress more on the importance of CPI in getting selected! If you cannot do anything about it now, ignore this!

Good Luck :))
