## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
I wasn't shortlisted for any other company.

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
YouTube videos about relevant topics

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Technical round contained questions about my interests. I showed interest in the design aspect of mechanical engineering and that's where he asked me questions from.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Be very careful about the examples that you use in your interview. For just one moment, I went on a tangent and mentioned the word 'gimbals'. Then, he started asking questions about gimbals. So, only use words that you know about. Also, show them that you are curious and that you want to learn more. Also, note that they judge you overall. They don't just see you as an employee, but as a person. If you're charismatic and smiling, then believe it or not, it does have an effect on your interview. The HR person even mentioned once that you look really happy and excited and that it's good.
