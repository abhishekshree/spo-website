## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
nan

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
GeeksForGeeks, InterviewBit, Brainstellar

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
There was one coding question, and a few generic (easy) CS questions from courses like CS220 etc. Other questions were mainly around projects in my resume and my technical interests.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Start early with coding practice, try giving timed tests if you can. Also try to do a few decent projects which you can talk about in detail during the interview. Do ask questions to the interviewer if given the chance, it helps to know about the work culture and technologies used in the company.
