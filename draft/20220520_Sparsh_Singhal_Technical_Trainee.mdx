## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
nan

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
The common courses CHE221, CHE211, ESO201, & CHE261 are the best resources for preparing for the technical test and technical interview round. I prepared for aptitude as well, since selection process consists of an aptitude test also. Basic concepts of probability and statistics might also create an upper edge in the interview.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
In my interview one question was asked about mass transfer which was not taught till 4th semester. So I had to solve the question through logic of my own. However HR interview consisted of general questions and the discussion was building upon the follow up of what I said and my resume.
## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
You don't have to focus on calculation part much in the courses but try to understand all the concepts and its applications. For preparing GDs practice at least 4-5 times before the actual one. The GDs conducted by AnC council would suffice. The one thing that is neglected the most but will become your deciding factor is HR questions practice. Be prepared well for that and don't start playing everything like a tape recorder, instead try to make the conversation sound more natural.
