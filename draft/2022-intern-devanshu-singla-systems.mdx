## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Rubrik, Sprinkler, DE Shaw

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
I prepared for cp on InterviewBit in the summers and did some random Leetcode questions. I also learned OOP from Geeks for Geeks.

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
My questions involved two simple puzzles which are very common in interviews and two coding problems which were of LC medium level. They also asked a few questions related to OOP.

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Try to atleast complete InterviewBit before internship season as it helps to build a good foundation in cp. Also read about OOP as it is frequently asked in interviews.
