Nikhil Verma, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Btech student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Product Engineer profile at Sprinklr. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Graviton : Software profile
● De Shaw : Software profile
● Sprinklr: Product Engineer

## Insights on the Selection Process
I would suggest moving on to the next question if you are not able to solve the
current question, in any case do not get stuck on a single question for too long
if you are not making any progress in that question. I would suggest being
friendly, but not casual with your interviewer, and being a little concise in your
answers. Interviewers also give hints for helping you out, and they also note
how well you are utilizing their hints in solving your answers.

##  Preparation Resources
Codeforces, Interviewbit / Leetcode, GFG, Brainstellar these are the resources that worked best for me

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Make the most of your summer. Three months are enough to prepare for any desired role, provided you
dedicate enough effort in enhancing your coding skills and other relevant topics. Interact with your
friends for support and motivation and remember to keep motivating your friends who are going
through the same process as you, as the preparation journey can be quite stressful at times.
Avoid procrastination and improve your coding skills in this summer even if you are not aiming for
coding-centric roles, having strong coding skills is highly beneficial.
