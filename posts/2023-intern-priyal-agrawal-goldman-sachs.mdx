Priyal Agrawal, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
her summer internship in Quant profile at Goldman Sachs. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Insights on the Selection Process
I had three rounds of interviews. The first one had questions based on probability and puzzles and a DSA question on sorting in which I just had to explain the algorithm. The second round was entirely based on coding and DSA in which I was asked four questions (topics covered were graphs, arrays, trees) . I had to come up with algorithms to solve the problems and I was also asked to code them on paper. The third round was entirely probability based. It had questions on the concepts on probability (like applications of bayes' theorem, expected value etc.) and puzzles similar to that of brainstellar. Besides these, in each round, I was asked questions about my resume. I was asked to describe one of my projects in detail in each of the three rounds.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1. Practice for the test as much as you can
2. Study in a group so that you develop a habit of discussing your ideas with people
3. Practice coding on paper
4. Focus on the concepts as in the final interview, they are interested in how you think more than how much you know
5. Stay motivated and don't get disheartened if you are unable to clear tests/interviews in the starting. There'll be enough opportunities to prove yourself
6. Don't worry about the results. Enjoy the process :)
