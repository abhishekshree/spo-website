Soham Ghosal, studying in IIT Kanpur as a Double Major student in ME will do his summer internship in Software Developer profile at Google. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Rubrik (Software), Sprinklr, Goldman Sachs, Quadeye(Systems), DE Shaw

## Insights on the Selection Process
Google: Google interview had some pretty original looking CP problems. So if someone is well versed with cp, it's a positive. I was asked a question on binary search in the first round (and certain interesting followups, which eventually led to a recursive solution). Just ensure that you know the behind-the-scenes implementation of whatever data structure you are using. In the second interview, I was asked a segment tree question. The second round was considerably harder than the first one.

DE Shaw: DE shaw focuses a lot on the cs fundamental concepts. Be well versed with oops, os(if possible).

Rubrik: Rubrik tries to ask interesting questions in the interview. The questions were drawn from concepts in operating systems. It was an interesting interview for me personally.

Goldman Sachs: GS asked basic DSA questions.Leetcode should be enough for this. 

##  Preparation Resources
Codeforces, Leetcode, Atcoder, 50 Challenging Problems in Probabiltiy, Brainstellar

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Do competitive programming. It might not seem relevant initially, but trust me once the tests start, it will work wonders. Also, CP enables your mind to always have a systematic approach, which is very much required in the interview. The interviewer is not there to just watch you code something up. While practicing, make it a habit to speak out your thought process. In the interview, make sure that you are able to convey everything you have in your mind to the interviewer. Finally, just be calm and remember that the interviewer is more of your colleague during the interview, and he/she will always be there to help you, in case you get stuck. All the best!"
