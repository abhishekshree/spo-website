Kunwar Preet Singh , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Trading profile at Optiver. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Tower (Quant), Glean US, Quantbox, Quadeye, Graviton (Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
For any quant profile, have firm grasp on probability theory, revise contents of CS203/equivalent and try out questions and puzzles available on brainstellar and 50 challenging Problems. 

For Software, learn standard DSA concepts from some site like interview bit or G4G. Interviewbit is generally recommended. If you are very short on time, skimming through G4G DSA pages is also helpful. I personally couldn't find time to do interviewbit and just did G4G. I will not recommend starting interviewbit before  summer break, rather if you are interested in CP try Codeforces instead.

For Optiver in specific, try to improve mental thinking speed, like calculations for example.

##  Preparation Resources
Brainstellar
50 challenging Problems in Probability
G4G

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Try to follow the above general advice for both the profiles and don't focus your prep particularly towards a specific company too much.

For Jane Street and Optiver, I think it's best to just throughly read the guides they provide and then just go into the interview without any specific expectations or prepration.
