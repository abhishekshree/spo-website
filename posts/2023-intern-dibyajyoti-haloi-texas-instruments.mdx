## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
nan

## Insights on the Selection Process

##  Preparation Resources
For SDE  profile I have practiced questions from gfg and interview bit from the last 3 months. And for core profile my previous knowledge about core courses related to the profile helps. The aptitude questions I have prepared from brainstellar and also revised mso201 course notes.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Just utilize the summer properly and don't get demotivated by your friend's selection and focus on your weakness and try to improve it over time.
