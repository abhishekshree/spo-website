Shubh Agrawal, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Software Development profile at Rubrik. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Google, Rubrik, Uber, Graviton, Tower Research, Quadeye, Microsoft, Sprinklr

## Insights on the Selection Process
In SDE role, most of the interviews are based upon algorithms and Data Structures only. You will be given questions and you will have to solve them and write code/pseudo code and then even explain it. Explaining is the most important step. Also try to give good names to variables, in one of the interview I was asked to change all the variable names so that the code looks good. Also in some cases you might be asked questions from some of the courses, but that chance of asking that is less.

In quant roles, generally  puzzles and probability questions are asked. 

##  Preparation Resources
Interviewbit, CodeForces

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Try to wrap up all the things you do in summers by June end. From July the things get a bit time consuming, you will first have to give time to make resume and then the coding rounds are soon lined up and then preparing for interview. All this require much time.
Also do practice from the test series from archives, they are really good set of question.
