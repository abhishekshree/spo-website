Kajal Deep, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
her summer internship in investment Banking - Summer Analyst profile at Goldman Sachs. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Google (Software Engineer),  Microsoft (TPM-PM), DE Shaw (Financial Services)

## Insights on the Selection Process
Topics asked - graph, arrays, tree, strings
Google interview is entirely DSA based. They don't ask anything from resume. Not every detail is provided from the very beginning of the question, don't get stuck, ask for more details and clarification. 
DE Shaw - Medium-Hard level DSA questions are asked. Then there are questions on OOPs, especially if it is mentioned in the resume. Questions related to projects or topics mentioned in the resume may be asked.
Goldman Sachs - Easy-medium level DSA questions are asked. Questions on probs and stats, and projects, topics mentioned in the resume are also asked (not in my case, they asked only DSA questions).

##  Preparation Resources
Interview Bit, Geeks for Geeks, Leetcode, Brainstellar, Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
- Start your preparation as early as you can
- People interested in Software profile, should try to do coding consistently and not just wait for the last 3 months to start coding
- It would be better if interviewbit questions are solved while doing ESO207 or any other DSA course (if doing) to give your internship preparation an early start
