Avinash Prasad, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Summer Intern profile at Goldman Sachs. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
NIL

## Insights on the Selection Process
Well they mostly asked questions from data structures and algorithms. There was a bit of mathematics involved but that's to be expected. Some questions were also from the projects on my Resume.

##  Preparation Resources
I regularly practiced competitive coding on Codeforces and Codechef. Also, I had done data structures and algorithms course from my department, so I had knowledge of data structures quite well. Also, InterviewBit played a very important role. I practiced a lot from there which actually helped me in my interviews. Other resources like GeeksforGeeks and cp-algorithms were also a great help.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
If you want to get a Software role, sincerely study data structures and algorithms. While practicing coding will help you get past technical tests, having a broad knowledge about them will help you in your interviews.
