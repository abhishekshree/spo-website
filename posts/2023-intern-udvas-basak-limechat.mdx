Udvas Basak, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in AE will do
his summer internship in ML profile at LimeChat. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Wells Fargo (SDE)
● LimeChat (ML)

## Insights on the Selection Process
The HR round will be a great opportunity to meet the founders, and
to understand their frequency. They are always looking for
motivated(and I mean it) individuals over everything.

##  Preparation Resources
Mostly followed the SPO Mock Tests, and regular SDE practise from CodeForces. For ML,
the Coursera courses by Andrew NG seems enough

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Be confident. Goes a long way.
