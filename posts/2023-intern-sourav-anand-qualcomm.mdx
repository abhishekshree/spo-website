Sourav Anand, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Software profile at Qualcomm. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Qualcomm

## Insights on the Selection Process
The test included some tricky MCQs but it was not much difficult. I
received the mail for the interview 24 hours prior to the interview and
hence had sufficient time for its preparation. The interview was
scheduled to be of 45 minutes but it went for over an hour. The
interviewer was quite polite and comforted me whenever I got stuck in
some question. The questions were very basic. Overall, the interview
went quite smoothly.

##  Preparation Resources
GFG, Youtube channels like Code with Harry, Apna College for DSA and Aditya Verma’s
playlist for dp concepts.
For practising all these concepts, I solved Interviewbit problems regularly.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
My only advice to the juniors is that you must be consistent with your efforts no matter how
good or bad your performance/score is. Just Don’t give up!!
