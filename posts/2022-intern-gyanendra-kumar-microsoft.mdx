## Insights on the Selection Process
I have only 1 round of interviews with Microsoft as I was a part of Engage Mentorship program. The round is named AA round (As Appropriate). There is only one interviewer, and he has an experience of more than 20 years with Microsoft. Since I was a part of the mentorship program, the initial 15 mins discussion was on my project. He asked me to give a quick demo of my project, open the source code, and explain what I have done and why I did it. Then he asked about my previous internship experience, which was very brief (2-5 min only). After all this, they came to DSA ( Data Structure and Algorithm). He put one sample test case of the linked list in the comment box and asked me to predict the possible question. I predicted around 4-5 possible questions. Then he gave me a second test case, and I was successfully able to predict the questions. The question is straightforward once you predict the question. The question is as follows: Given a linked list, split it into two halves, reverse both halves, and connect the end of the first linked list. In the end, they ask me to code the same problem.

## Adivce for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1. Prepare well for the coding round. 
2. Mostly, DP questions are asked in the coding round.  
3. Make sure to have good practice beforehand.  
4. It may be possible that during the initial days of the internship season, you will not be able to grab an internship offer, but if you prepare well, then you will get the offer in the latter part of the drive. Internship season is spread throughout the year. Focus more on your preparation.
