Shrey Mehta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Software Engineer profile at Samsung Korea. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver, Quadeye, DE Shaw

## Insights on the Selection Process
Samsung Korea:
The main focus while shortlisting is on CPI, whose criteria is generally >=9. The coding test includes one question, typically based on a brute force approach but requires you to analyse all the edge cases very well.
The interview comprised of one question based on string-matching, and then all your resume projects were thoroughly gone through. Then, there was an HR Round which mainly contained questions like your motivation to join Samsung or to come to Korea.

Optiver:
It has two rounds of Technical tests which test your mental ability, quick maths and verbal reasoning. Then for the Quant role, the shortlisted students have the Group Discussion having a few games related to market making and strategy. Then there are final interviews with HR and Technical rounds. The main focus is on your quick maths and mental ability.

Quadeye:
The shortlist criteria are CPI>=9. There are direct interviews where they test you on probability and strategy for the quant roles and DSA Concepts and OOPs for the Systems Role.

DE Shaw:
The technical test comprised three coding questions based mainly on Maths and DP. Then, the interviews had two technical rounds. The questions were based on heaps, linked lists and queues. Then, there were questions on different concepts of OOPs like encapsulation, virtual function, etc.

##  Preparation Resources
I began the preparation for the intern season at the start of the summer vacation.
For software roles, you should be proficient with DSA, with can be done through GFG or lecture notes of ESO207. After that, you can start practising questions from InterviewBit and LeetCode. Additionally, regularly giving contests on Codeforces and CodeChef is a plus.
For the quant part, the basic concepts of probability could be covered from CS203 lecture notes and then questions can be practised from BrainStellar and 50 Challenging Problems in Probability.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Utilise your vacation well in covering the topics related to DSA if aiming for a software role and the probability of seeking the quant ones.
Software roles generally require a decent practice of Competitive Programming on various platforms like Codeforces and going through topic-wise questions of InterviewBit or LeetCode.
Also, emphasis is put on your knowledge about OOPs, so learn about its basic terms and operations.
