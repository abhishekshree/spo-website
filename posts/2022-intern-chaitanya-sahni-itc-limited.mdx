Chaitanya Sahni, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in ME will do
his summer internship in Techno-Managerial profile at ITC Limited. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Hindustan Unilever (Techno Managerial)

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist and personal questionnaire form : High CPI is important
2. GD: Directed GD amd GD usually presents a moral dilemma as topic where you choose what to give priority to.
3. Interview Process: There were 2 interviews in total post GD. The first interview was more on the technical side whereas the second was a general interview seeking to know more about your personality.

The personal questions form should be filled with care. The answers should show clarity in the direction you are headed. For the GD the best steps to follow are to be aware of others peoples points and not repeat. Also you should try to bring a different angle from others. Stick to your decisions and make arguments in a formal manner.

The GD question for me was related to a company which gave workers houses within the company plant. The house allocation was usually done on seniority basis however we were presented with a dilemma in this case were there were some special cases in addition to the senior most worker. We were to decide based on this who we would allocate the house to. The technical interview was focused primarily on my resume. They asked in depth about projects I was pursuing and some course related questions as well.

##  Preparation Resources
My preparation for the GD was done by interacting with some seniors and taking part in mock GD’s arranged by the ANC. After the GD I did some basic research into standard interview questions and prepared myself for those. Apart from this I also did some background research on the company I was interviewing for. We must be prepared for what we have written in our resume as they will surely pick up on those points and ask to explain them.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Be thorough while preparing resume. Do not panic or feel dejected when you do not see your name in the list. Intern season is stressful, prepare well beforehand and dedicate time daily for your betterment. Apart from this focus on your soft skills as they also play an important role to get you intern.
