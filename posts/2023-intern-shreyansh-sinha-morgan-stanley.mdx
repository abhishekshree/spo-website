Shreyansh Sinha, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in MTH will do
his summer internship in Quant profile at Morgan Stanley. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Tower Research, Uber, Boston Consulting Group, Bain

## Insights on the Selection Process
Practice Dynamic Programming and Graphs well as most of the questions asked in the coding round or interview will be from this.
Pick any one resource and try to complete it throughly before moving to other resource as depth matters more than breadth. Also, practice all the standard questions well and try to form a peer group where you can discuss approaches as it benefits a lot. For puzzles brain-stellar and 50 challenging problems are more than enough. For Consulting roles, case-prep can be done well in 20-25 days.

##  Preparation Resources
Interviewbit, Brainsteller, 50 challenging problems in probability 

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Try to be motivated throughout the summers as well as internship drive. Also, if you haven’t done coding before summers then also their is sufficient time so don’t loss hope. All the best for your interns
