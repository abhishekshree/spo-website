Aditya Vats, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in ME will do
his summer internship in Techno-Managerial profile at ITC Limited. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
HUL

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. The first round is filling a very detailed form. This constitutes everyThing from your achievements to your life goals etc. I believe it’s to understand how actively you are engaged in progressing your career and yourself.

2. Second round is basically the short listing for GD. The short listing is done on the basis of your form, your CPI, and your resume. I believe a CPI > 8.5 will suffice.

3. My GD was online and it was a very quick case study. A situation was provided and 3-4 people were asked to come to a consensus for a solution. The selection over this was pretty much how any GD selection goes. You speak up, speak logically, don’t criticise, be courteous but put your point across. 

4. After getting selected, you have another 2 rounds of interviews. You must be very thorough with your resume. Technical questions were asked of me but not related to my coursework. Some general stuff like what motors do we use in our bot (related to a project of mine). So have at least 10 minutes of speaking content on each of your project points (yup, 10 minutes for each bullet point). Be very thorough here.

5. Almost all the questions were about your resume points. So if you had written for eg something about Random Forest Classifiers, they are going to go to the depth of it. So ensure that you are able to justify all your points.They may ask very unrelated questions, that they know you don’t have the technical expertise to know. These are just to ensure you don’t get baffled by stuff. Stay calm and answer to the best of your abilities.

##  Preparation Resources
I was not really preparing much for internship. I had done some GD practice with my friends, at least 3-4 mock GDs. Was doing some coding on interviewbit and some quant practice (50 challenging problems etc). I was not very rigorous in my prep. What helped me I guess, was that I had done lot of work in my semester time, Projects, Teams, Internship. All that actually helped me in the ITC shortlisting.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
I would suggest to stay calm and relaxed in interviews. A relaxed and positive vibe actually creates a big difference in such interviews. Nobody wants a nervous wreck in their company. So smile, make light conversation with the interviewers while answering their questions seriously. That shows that you are confident in dealing with new situations.
