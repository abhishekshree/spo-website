Mrinal Kumar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in ME will do
his summer internship in Data Analyst - Investment Banking profile at Goldman Sachs. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
nan

## Insights on the Selection Process
In my first interview there was an array Question. They asked about time complexity, space complexity and how to further reduce them.
Next question was to develop a strategy to maximize the probability of winning a dice game. They asked to explain the strategy using expected value.
Third question was on real valued functions of MTH101.

In second interview there was a coding question on rain water harvesting and to write its pseudo code. 
Next question was to organise data and develop an algorithm to find exchange rate between two currencies. (Little hard to explain the question but can be easily solved using trees)
Final question was to develop a sure fire strategy to win a game of placing coins on a table.  

##  Preparation Resources
SPO resources, Interviewbit, GFG, Leetcode.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Start working on your coding skills. Also be knowledgeable about OOPs .Write honestly about your projects and revise them before interview. In both of my interviews they asked about my project for about 10 minutes. Also they can sometime ask about coursework thats related to the profile, in my case - IME672. Don't be hesistant during the interview, if you don't understand a term ask about it from them and they will explain or change the question.
