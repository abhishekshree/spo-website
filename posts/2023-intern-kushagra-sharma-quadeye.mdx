Kushagra Sharma, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Quant profile at Quadeye. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver(Quant), Optiver(Software), Quantbox(Quant), Graviton(Software), Quadeye(Quant and Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
Optiver- Quant interview involves quick calculations, presence of mind and probability and combinatorics. Software interview includes system design and a coding interview.
Quantbox (Quant) - Asked several hard and non-intuitive probability questions
Quadeye (Quant) - Several a few prob-stats questions
Graviton and Quadeye (Software) - Asked a few LeetCode Hard questions, along with some Object-Oriented Programming questions

##  Preparation Resources
Quant prep: Solved puzzles and prob-stats questions on Brainstellar, 50-challenging problems.
Software prep: Primarily familiarized on the interview questions through LeetCode and Interviewbit. 

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
For Quant prep - Try to do a probability course before sitting for interview (MSO/CS203). Solve puzzles on Brainstellar and try to complete 50-challenging problems in Probability. Ted-Ed riddles are also a good watch.
For Software prep - Familiarize yourself on Object-Oriented programming, get to know about the standard interview questions through LeetCode and InterviewBit. Giving contests on Codeforces/Codechef regularly can help build problem solving skills.

General- Try to maintain a good CPI before the intern season (>9), and utilize time optimally in the summers(Don't keep everything for the last minute)
