Shubham Sanjay Korde, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in EE will do
his summer internship in Techno-Managerial profile at ITC Limited. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Hindustan Unilever (Techno Managerial)

## Insights on the Selection Process
Shortlist
- Shortlisting done on the basis of Resume + Application form
- A good CGPA helps
- Having a project and a POR beneficial 

GD 
- Group Discussion with a batch of 6 people
- Common problem statement is given. You have to choose an option and try to convince others why that options should be choosen.
- Sample Question: There are 5 people who want to get an apartment in the residential complex. The traits and characteristics of all the 5 were given. Like one of them was the senior most, one did crucial time sensitive jobs, one was handicapped and so on. We had to decide and explain whom to give the room and convince everyone else why that was the correct choice.

Interviews
- 2 rounds of interviews: 1 Technical and 1 HR
- Explain one of the projects on your resume.
- What are the two important internationally important topics you deeply feel about? (HR)
- Which will be your ideal company to join apart from ITC? (HR)
- All other questions were resume specific (most of it was  conversations)


General Insights
- Having a good CGPA makes selection way easier.
- Clear speech, logical structure in arguments and persuasiveness in manner beneficial in clearing the GD. Exposure to public speaking and GD practices will surely help. 
- Basic questions on core courses like EE330, ESO203, ESC201 can be asked. Although I was asked none. Same for Mechanical and Chemical core courses.
- Have basic info for HR round like CEO name, products of the company, primary business market etc.

##  Preparation Resources
- I did not specifically prepare for techno managerial profiles. I had been debating for a couple of years by then so it was relatively easier for me to crack the GD.
- I watched a couple of youtube videos on basic tips to perform well GD before the GD.
- Do not forget to ask your friends who have already been in one of the previous batches what the question was. I knew the question well in advance before the GD. Although the question was not super difficult, it could make a difference if you get more time to think about your answer.
- I watched youtube videos on HR interview questions and correct answers to them. None of them helped as HR interviews are basically conversations. 


## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
- Have backup options ready if your target is techno-managerial profile because the number of good companies in this profile are very few. It is also possible because preparing for this profile does not require much hardwork.
- If you have never done any kind of public speaking or any such activity, practicing GD with your friends can be really helpful.
- Be as frank as you could during the interview. No need to fake. Most times the people interviewing you are extremely pleasant and make you feel comfortable. Take the interview just like a conversation. You wont even know when did the interview end.
- Don’t worry if you don’t get it. A significant part of the process is luck.
