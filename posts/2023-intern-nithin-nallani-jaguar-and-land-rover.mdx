his summer internship in Mechatronics Intern profile at Jaguar and Land Rover. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
nan

## Insights on the Selection Process
 Get some idea of all the major parts of a car. While having a
look try to relate your mechanical concepts to their
working.
 Try to have a decent CPI. But if it is not so good, don’t
worry. They will focus on your core projects too. Try to
have a good project under a professor or in any Team or
club.
 Learn some basic C++. The coding questions are easy and
scoring.
 Have a habit of Practicing some aptitude questions from
the SPO preparation portal or from any other source.
 Revise all your core courses thoroughly (mainly
thermodynamics, manufacturing, etc)
 Know about the company well, before the interview. And be
prepared with the reasoning for why you want to join JLR.
This is a typical question for every company.
 Try to look smart, don’t panic if you can’t answer a question
in the interview. Just say that you don’t know (in a formal
way). Or try to explain how much you know (they will judge
your thought process, not the final answer).

 They will ask for an intro. Avoid having it too short or too
long. Just say confidently what you are (try to cover all the
things that you want them to know). Prepare this intro
before itself, it will help in other company interviews also,
to get a good start by avoiding awkward stammering.

##  Preparation Resources
Nothing special. Just the coursework and projects help. Find suitable resources for basic
coding in C++ and for aptitude (there are plenty of them).

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
 It’s ok if you stammer or panic in the interview. Just try to get the situation as much
better as possible. This is a technical interview; they don’t expect you to have
exceptional soft skills.
 No issue if you can’t answer all the questions, just say no quickly if you don’t know the
answer. So that you will get a chance to answer more questions.
 Try to give a real picture of you. If it is a lie, then the interviewers will find out easily
and it will give a bad impression on you.
 Start your core project as early as possible so that you can have much time to do it
well.
