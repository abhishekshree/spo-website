insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Proctor and Gamble (Techno-Managerial), ITC (Techno-Managerial), Goldman Sachs ( Software )

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist
    - Based on a form we had to fill about us, general HR
questions etc

2. GD
    - Case questions given like what can we do for delivery truck drivers etc
    - Had to record a 15 min video live on their platform for 3 - 4 questions

3. Interview Process
    - 2 interview rounds
    - First round: Few HR questions, and resume based questions
    - Second round: Extensively course based (Thermo, Mechanics) and project based questions – more detailed than first round

Test questions:

1. Which POR do you like and why? 
2. How does a boomerang work?

##  Preparation Resources
1. Previous case study question given by seniors.

3. Internet Surfing on key words like six-sigma, supply chain ( less useful during interviews though).
4. Visited the company website, read latest initiatives.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1. Cracking the process doesn’t require extensive one-time preparation, we build the profile round the year, try to relate answers to HR questions with what you learned during your POR experiences.
2. Focus on applications of stuff we read in courses.
3. Be confident with what you say in the interview, if you don’t know the answer do not fool around, and politely refuse.
4. Practice a lot of GDs, try to open, interact and also let others speak.
5. Do not go theoretical with your answers, specially in HR questions, try to relate to experiences.
