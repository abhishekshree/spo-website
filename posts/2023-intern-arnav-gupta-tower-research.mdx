insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:

## Insights on the Selection Process
The interview process at Tower consisted of 2 rounds. In the first round, I was asked about a project in my resume, basics of pipelining, a couple of problems on linked lists, and 2 puzzles. 
The second round was relatively small where I was again asked about my resume and a probability problem.

##  Preparation Resources
Interviewbit and CSES problemset for programming, and 50 challenging problems, Brainstellar for probability/puzzles.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Try to maintain a CPI above 9 for quant/software roles, and start the preparation early on. In the interviews, keep calm and think out loud.
