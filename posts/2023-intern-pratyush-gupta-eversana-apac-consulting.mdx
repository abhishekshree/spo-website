Insights on the
Selection Process
●
Resume selection was based on either high CPI and/or any
extraordinary POR or extra-curricular activity but mostly CPI. ●
Emphasis on ‘why consulting?’. ●
Researching about the company’s services and culture through
linkedin and company’s official website helped a lot in the
interview. Prior knowledge of the industry was handy while
solving the case interview.

##  Preparation Resources
1. Victor Cheng’s playlist on YouTube containing 12 videos.
2. Victor Cheng’s book – ‘Case Interview Secrets’
3. IITB Casebook – ‘Case Interview’s Cracked’
4. Maybe checkout Victor Cheng’s website – https://caseinterview.com

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1. Thoroughly understand consulting culture and industry.
2. Make notes regarding the different types of case interview problems and frameworks.
3. Brush up mental math – will help crunching numbers during guesstimates.
4. If possible, practice solving Case Interviews with your peers.
5. ALWAYS, communicate what you are thinking while solving any problem during the
interview. Arriving at the right answer is NOT AT ALL important. What matters is
whether you follow a structured analytical approach or not.
6. Don’t Give Up! I was rejected in 5 interviews (final stage) before finally clearing the cut.
A lot is based on luck too.
