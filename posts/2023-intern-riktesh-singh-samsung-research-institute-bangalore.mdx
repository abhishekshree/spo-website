## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1- In an interview always tell them the naïve approach first then slowly move to the most 
optimised solution. 
2- In the first month most of the company will ask questions only from graph, trees, BST 
and linked list in their interviews. 
3- Give mock interviews to your seniors before going for any interview, and don't panic in 
front of HR or your interviewer. Don't call them Sir/Ma'am. They are just 4-5 yrs older than you, so call them by their name and always ask about the interviewer at the end of the interview like what was the first project He/She did in that company? 
4- Go through some frequent interview questions and answers on gfg, prepbytes,etc. 5- Before any company's interview try to go through the previous year questions of same 
company's interviews which are available under gfg interview experience tab.
