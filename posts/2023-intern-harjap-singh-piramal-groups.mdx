Harjap Singh, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CHE will do
his summer internship in Pharma profile at Piramal Groups. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Microsoft (TPM&PM) , WorldQuant (Quant), Edelweiss (Quant), Piramal Group (Pharma)

## Insights on the Selection Process
 Microsoft:
In each round, I had done case -discussions. Basically in case discussions, I was assigned a task of designing a app(like car-rental app, music app for blind people, ride app for blue-collar workers).Some questions about technical aspects like (frontend ,backened, user-interface) were also asked.

WorldQuant:
They asked general questions about my interest in finance and my projects. They asked 2 puzzles( how to create equal-probable event from biased coin ,  other is based on Bayesian probability) and one question of maths. After that some general HR questions.

Edelweiss:
They went deeper in my one of project and asked 2-3 math questions where I had to prove something. I was also asked two guesstimates questions and one of the interviewbit puzzle.

Piramal Group:
General questions about distillation column, its application and commercialization was asked. Then bunch of HR questions about my goals, strength, weakness and reason for choosing chemical Engineering. 



##  Preparation Resources
I started my preparations from second week of May. I already went though some of data structures before preparations but still follow the time table shared by SPO. Along with coding, I was also engaged in 2 projects. This was typical schedule that I follow till mid-June. After that, I also started looking for puzzles on "Gurmeet Puzzles", "Braingle"  and "Brainstellar". I also looked about "Guesstimates and case interviews".


## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Well prepared before D-Day begins. It will happen many times that things are not going as you think or hope. But just have a faith on yourself, learn from mistakes and keep on trying.
