Tejas Ramakrishnan , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in R&D  profile at Samsung Electronics . Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver Quant, Optiver Software, Quadeye Quant, Quadeye systems

## Insights on the Selection Process
Dynamic programming, graphs, backtracking for samsung coding round. Prepare brainstellar and 50 cp for Quant roles, and market making really helps in optiver. OOPS(specifically runtime polymorphism) a popular question in Quadeye systems/ other systems interviews. 

##  Preparation Resources
Interviewbit for coding, brainstellar and 50 cp for probability and puzzles

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Along with interviewbit, prepare codeforces and solving questions within a time limit(can do the pclub archive contests) for the coding tests, because I think only doing interviewbit doesn't usually give the required speed or accuracy under the time constraint. Don't take the HR round of companies like Samsung lightly. Stay calm during the interview, and use the hints given by the interviewer.
