 Have a strong grasp of probability skills and how to apply them in real-world scenarios.
 Highlight your strengths and accomplishments during the interview, and how they
relate to the company's interests and needs.
 Be confident and articulate in your responses, while also being open to feedback and
constructive criticism.
