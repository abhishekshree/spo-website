Aryaman Singhal, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in MTH will do
his summer internship in Sales and Trading profile at Morgan Stanley. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
N.A.

## Insights on the Selection Process
Apart from the technical questions, they asked me about every detail about my resume. So you must be prepared. You need to know about everything you have mentioned in the resume, like club projects, undergraduate project, what all you learned in them. 

##  Preparation Resources
My preparation included mostly Mathematics and the basics of Finance. Sites such as brainstellar, and other websites helped me get better at strategy puzzles, probability based questions. Mostly brainteasers were asked. For finance, it was mostly basic questions, that you would be aware of if you just have curiosity, and be willing to understand financial terms, that you sometimes hear, such as IPO, angel investor, Debt, Bonds, Stocks. Not very high level knowledge is required ot expected for Finance.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Be calm, I did get a little nervous, and if you mention anything on your resume, make sure you really understand it.
