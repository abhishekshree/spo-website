Saksham Mehra, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in EE will do his summer internship in Hardware Engineer profile at Google. Here are some brief insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
NA

## Insights on the Selection Process
Google shortlists students directly on the basis of resume, without any tests. Having core EE projects on resume is the key.  There were 2 rounds of interview. First was based entirely on verilog . Second round was more focused upon the digital part of ESC201 and there was one coding question .If you are thorough with your concepts from EE courses, you can crack the interview . Some questions are tricky , but the interviewer keeps on giving hints at points where you get stuck. The questions are focused upon the real life application of your EE concepts.

##  Preparation Resources
1) Most important is 2nd year core EE courses like EE210, EE200, EE250 and ESC201. Going through the lecture material , giving to you in these courses should be sufficient. 

2) You can also go through the CMOS inverters part of the EE370 lectures as a plus, if you are thorough with ESC201 and EE210. The EE370 lectures are available on YouTube.

3) Having a decent knowledge of HDL, such as verilog/VHDL(any one) is also important for the interview process. I prepared for it from CS220 lectures (available on course website). However any online tutorial may suffice. The above resources are general for all core EE profiles.

4) For software roles, I mainly focused upon solving questions from Interviewbit regularly and also revised ESO207 concepts.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1) Luck factor plays a major role in the internship process. So do not worry if you are not able to get shortlisted or crack the interviews. Keep patience and believe in your skills , whatever profile you are preparing for. 

2) Also refrain from applying for every profile. Make sure, you decide by the start of the summers , which roles you are preparing for, and focus your time and energy on them. 

In case of any other doubt , feel free to contact :)
