Sarthak Goyal , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in Earth science will do
his summer internship in Software  profile at Goldman sachs. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
nan

## Insights on the Selection Process
I had 3 rounds in the interview and I was asked 7 questions on dsa...
1. Standard scheduling question (sorting)
2. Question on heap
3. Nearest greatest integer (Stacks)
4. Find the maximum zigzag path in a tree
5. Convert tree in doubly linked list in constant space
6. Binary search in rotates sorted array
7. Frog just question (DP)

##  Preparation Resources
Do all questions from https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/ , I would suggest to do every question of every topic. Give 20-30 mins to each question, if you are unable to solve it them look for its approach and try to code it.
DP, stacks, sliding window, binary search- https://www.youtube.com/c/AdityaVermaTheProgrammingLord/playlists
for DP I prefered videos from takeyouforward more, I think they were more bigenner friendly

I didnt found any good resource for graph so I mostly looked for algorithms seperately through GFG or https://cp-algorithms.com Still you can look here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0rGEWe64KWas0Nryn7SCRWw
I studied OOPS after the interndrive started from here: https://www.studytonight.com/python/oops-in-python
For probability and puzzles go through all the questions from here: https://mbapreponline.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fifty_challenging_problems_in__2.pdf
Do medium to hard puzzles from here: https://brainstellar.com/

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Be consistent till the end without getting demotivated and surely before the summer you will have an intern in your hand. A senior told me this and I followed it till the day of getting shortlisted and it motivated me a lot. Give CP a try, if you like doing it then start doing it and be consistent it will definitely be very helpful during the intern drive.
