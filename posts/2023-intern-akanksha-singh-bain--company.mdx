Akanksha Singh , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
her summer internship in Associate consultant intern profile at Bain & Company. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Boston Consulting Group, Microsoft PM/TPM, Quantbox Systems, Alphagrep Software, Alphagrep Quant(offer), Quadeye, Sprinklr

## Insights on the Selection Process
Market sizing(shaving razor market in Indonesia) and unconventional cases(additional revenue streams for Google apart from ads, improving user experience for food delivery apps) were asked in my consulting interviews.

C++ and stl implementation details and basic graph, dp and two pointer questions were asked in the quant interviews.

##  Preparation Resources
SDE:
I followed the SPO 8 week plan and completed all topics(did atleast a few questions from each) on interviewbit. (Would recommend codeforces for timed practice).

Consulting:
Resources: 1. Victor cheng's case interviews playlist
2. IITB Casebook

Practice: I practiced 2-3 cases with batchmates and 10 Cases with alums/seniors. I wrote down and analysed the feedback and worked on not making the same mistakes in the subsequent mocks. 

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1. Be consistent in your preparation, doing even three hours of prep per day all summer can drastically improve your chances.
2. For consulting, do a lot of mocks with seniors, and take their feedback seriously. Preferably also get seniors to review your cv.
3. Be confident in your interviews. No interviewer expects you to be perfect. Making mistakes or not knowing something in the interview is absolutely okay, you just need to keep your calm through the rest of it. 
4. For both coding tests and case interviews, focus on improving your aptitude/thought process rather than mugging up frameworks/algorithms.
