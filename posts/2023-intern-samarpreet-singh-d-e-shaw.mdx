Samarpreet Singh, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Technology (Software) Developer profile at D. E. Shaw. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Graviton (Quant), Microsoft (Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. D. E. Shaw - There was a technical test with 3 coding questions based on maths and dynamic programming. In the first round of technical interview, I was asked a problem based on map and prefix sums, and difference between unordered and ordered maps and their implementations. Since I didn't have knowledge regarding computer networks, the interviewer asked me questions based on Object-oriented programming (function overriding/overloading and inheritance). The second round involved standard problems based on trees and two pointers. Here too, Object-oriented programming was discussed. I was questioned about my projects as well in both rounds. 
2. Graviton - The technical test for quant role had 4 subjective questions based on probability, bitwise xor and functions. The technical interview comprised two different strategy-based problems, one of them involved several cases of egg-dropping problem with constraints on number of eggs and floors. There were some mental maths questions too.
3. Microsoft - There were 2 coding questions in the test. In one, we were supposed to find triplets of collinear points and the other involved basic maths. There were two technical interview rounds with one basic coding question in each of them. In the first, I was supposed to find minimum element in stack in constant time and in the second, I had to find root node of a tree, given its parent-child relations. There was a rigorous discussion on my resume as well.

##  Preparation Resources
I began my intern prep at the start of summer vacation.
For software role preparation, I had finished all the topics on interviewbit. I practiced some questions based on dynamic programming and graphs from leetcode and cses. Also, I frequently gave contests on codeforces in the first half of my vacation. I watched some videos from Striver's dynamic programming playlist as well. 
For quant role preparation, I revised the concepts from CS203 lecture notes and completed puzzles from Brainstellar and the 50 challenging problems book. I had gone through the book Xinfeng Zhou as well.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1. Utilize your vacation time effectively. The 2-3 month period is sufficient for decent preparation.
2. If aiming for software roles, try your best to give coding contests on codeforces and codechef on a regular basis as it would enhance your problem-solving skills.
