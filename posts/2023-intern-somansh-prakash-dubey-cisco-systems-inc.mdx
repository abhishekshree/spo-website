Somansh Prakash Dubey, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in Mechanical will do
his summer internship in Software Engineering profile at Cisco Systems, Inc.. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Cisco Systems, Inc.
● Optiver – 3rd round
● J. P. Morgan
● Wells Fargo
● Piramal
● Jaguar Land-Rover

## Insights on the Selection Process
● Inclination towards networking is required (1 project for
software (development) is sufficient)
● Interview asks mostly networking questions, so brushing
up those concepts is necessary after shortlisting.
● A very good understanding of Resume projects is required
(Most of the discussion is based on that in the interview)

##  Preparation Resources
● SPO coding roadmap
● InterviewBit for coding practice
● CrakX mobile application for Company specific technical question + HR questions

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do’s
● A very good hold over coding (one good attempt of InterviewBit is sufficient, but it
takes time).
● Most of the interview preparation happens after getting shortlisted for it, so I’d
recommend talk to seniors.
● Practice mock interviews with friends in the summer season itself. You need to talk to
the interviewer for approximately 1 hour on just your resume.
Don't's
● Don’t fall for projects that are not aligning with your targeted profile in the summers just
before intern season.
