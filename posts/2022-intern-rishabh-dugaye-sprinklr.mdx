Rishabh Dugaye, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Product Engineer profile at Sprinklr. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Uber-SDE, Microsoft-ML

## Insights on the Selection Process
For Sprinklr:

1st round had Questions on Binary search, Median of stream of numbers,Implementation of heap and basic questions about sorting algorithms.

2nd round had questions on base conversion,Least recently used cache using DLL and SLL,Implementation of Trie and one puzzle which was from brainstellar hard.
In both rounds I was also asked about my projects and internships.

3rd round was HR.

For Uber:

1st round had a easy question on BST where given a BST root and a target T we need to split the tree into two trees where 1st tree has all nodes with values less than V and 2nd tree had value greater than V.This can be solved easily using recursion.

2nd round was HR and discussion on project.

3rd round was coding and had a problem implementation problem in which I was only supposed to write pseudocode of a brute force solution.

##  Preparation Resources
Coding-Interview Bit and PClub Archives.

Quant-50 challenging problems and brainstellar.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
I would suggest to start coding from May. In my opinion interview bit is sufficient for most of the companies. If you are preparing for companies like google, rubrik, TRC then you should really focus on doing competitive programming on codeforces. Apart from that P Club archives are really helpful and gives you a really good about about the difficulty of tests.
