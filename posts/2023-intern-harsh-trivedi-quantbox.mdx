Harsh trivedi , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Quantitative research  profile at Quantbox. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Google, quadeye, graviton

## Insights on the Selection Process
Google - Easy question in the coding round 1, in second round the coding question was good but solvable.
Graviton - 2 coding question which should be easy if you have practiced and the questions on computer organisation for SDE role.
Tower - 3 or 4 probability question which were hard for me and fun for interviewer xd. Overall it is super intense interview.
Quadeye - Again some coding and probability question which were very easy.
Samsung - Easy coding question but the HR round is intensive and you should know about korean culture.
Quantbox - Again some question were repeated from interviewbit and the interview that I had given but in some questions the interviewer was helpful and we had a great discussion.

##  Preparation Resources
First of all start coding by giving contest on different platforms and the key to success is to  not skip even a single contest on codeforces, codechef and atcoder. This will create a good base then afterwards start solving problems on interviewbit they are super good and relatable to the tests.
The 2 main topic that I feel is asked most is DP and graph so once you are finished with interviewbit solve problems from these topics. And give the pclub contest seriously because they are the real test to measure your preparation.
Enough of coding now the next part needed especially for Quant profile is probability for which first finish "50 challenging problems", then brainstellar, if you still have time left then go for "practical guide for quantitative finance". 
Now your are ready for the interview all the best



## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Plan your preparation and complete interviewbit, branstellar and 50 challenging problem. Interview is all about confidence just think loud share your thought and take hint from the interviewer and you are good to go.
All the best
