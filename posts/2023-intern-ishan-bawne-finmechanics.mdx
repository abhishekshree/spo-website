Ishan Bawne, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in Physics will do
his summer internship in nan profile at Finmechanics. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Oracle
● Giva

● Finmechanics

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist

3. Interview Process
a. Two Rounds of Interview
b. Round 1 was on Probability and Problem-solving skills
and details about past internships and projects.
c. Round 2 was based on Programming aptitude, Resume,
and general HR Questions.

Insights on the
Selection Process

I observed that selection the process favored those who were good with
programming aptitude and had previous work experience in internships
and/or quality projects.

Sample Interview
/Test Questions

In the interview they asked about a graph optimization problem. They
framed the question as if it was a networking problem but essentially it
was a graph problem. Knowing Dijkstra Algorithm helped me there.

##  Preparation Resources
I used Leetcode for solving programming questions. And geeks for geeks for puzzles.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do’s
• Try to add quality projects to your resume.
• Previous work experience such as any internships would add great value to your
resume.
• In the interview don’t leave your ideas and opinions open to interpretation. Try to
communicate what you are thinking to the interviewer and make sure that they
understand it the way you want it to (With help of examples or by any other means).
Don’t’ ‘s
• Try to avoid talking about topics you don’t know about. If asked about those topics I
think it would be better to explicitly say that you didn’t come around those topics and
you would like to read about those topics. If you have valid justification for not knowing
you can give a short justification too.
