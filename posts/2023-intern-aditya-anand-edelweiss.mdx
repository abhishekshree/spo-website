Aditya Anand, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in ME will do
his summer internship in Quant Researcher profile at Edelweiss. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
JPMC-Quant

## Insights on the Selection Process
Projects focused mainly, puzzles (pigeonhole, no of occurrences for n heads, prob of forming a triangle by breaking stick in 3 pieces). Family background, future plans, why quant, why you type HR questions.

##  Preparation Resources
Stats- ZedStatistics YT, InterviewBit data analysis stats; Puzzle- Brainstellar (must do), InterviewBit, 50 Challenging Problem, Coding- InterviewBit, Leetcode

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Most importantly, know every word of your resume (probably the reason, why I wasn't selected for jpmc.) Try forming the answer of HR question beforehand, and prepare a script for introduction.
