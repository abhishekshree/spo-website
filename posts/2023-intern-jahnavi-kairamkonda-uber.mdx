Jahnavi Kairamkonda, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in CSE will do
her summer internship in SDE profile at Uber. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Google SDE, Goldman Sachs

## Insights on the Selection Process
Technical interviews had CP questions in both Uber and Google. Probability was asked in Goldman Sachs. 

##  Preparation Resources
I mostly concentrated on improving my coding skills because SDE was my target. Interviewbit was helpful throughout. In the end when it came to preparing for company specific or topic wise questions, I started using Leetcode.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Start DSA as early as possible. It’s always good to have more practice when it comes to that topic. Luck plays a role in everything. Do not get disheartened by rejections. Try to know what you missed and try improving for further tests and interviews.
