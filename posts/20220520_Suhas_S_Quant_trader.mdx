## Other companies & profiles that you were shortlisted for:
Samsung Korea, Google, Rubrik, Goldman Sachs, Quadeye, Graviton

## Some resources that you used during your preparation?
50 challenging problems, brainstellar, Interview Bit, Cracking the coding interview, Codeforces

## Can you list down the the topics on which questions were asked in the interviews or any other insights on the interview process?
Samsung Korea asked a question on Unbounded knapsack. SK's technical interview usually contains a well-known problem. Make sure you explain it slowly. SK's shortlisting criteria changes each year so don't read between the lines too much. SK's HR round is the most important. Try and watch a KDrama before. 
You can't really prepare for Optiver's interviews. Best thing I can suggest is to understand market making well and to play estimation and market making games before with your friends.
Google : Number of overlapping intervals, dp
Rubrik: Subtree dp, Greedy that required a non-intuitive observation
Quadeye: Estimation, PNC Expected value, and some useful limits and approximations in probability, Zero sum problem 

## Any specific advice that you have for students sitting for internship next year?
Best advice for coding would be to familiarise yourself with all the standard problems in different paradigms. Interview Bit does a good job at this. Then you can try LC medium or hard (depending on your comfort level). Also give archives seriously. It'll give you a rough idea of where you stand and also improve your temperament for giving timed tests. (refrain from using google during the contest). And it's also extremely important to be able to solve questions really quickly. On average you might get 20-30 mins per question, and you need to be able to write error free code within that time frame.
For quant, just try and solve puzzles from the above mentioned sources and try and remember it (maybe note down interesting problems and the trick to solve it). There have been instances where I wasn't able to solve a question I had seen before in the pressure of an interview setting.
Apart from all these technical things, the most important thing is to stay motivated and try and learn as much as you can during your preparation. I'm sure all of you are extremely smart and talented and can achieve anything you put your mind to. So believe in yourself! ^-^
