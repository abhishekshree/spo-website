Shorya Kumar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in EE will do
his summer internship in Product Engineer profile at Sprinklr. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver, DE Shaw, Graviton (SDE and Quant)

## Insights on the Selection Process
Quant 
1. Puzzles on probability and expected values 
2. Strategy and game theory puzzles 

SDE 
1. Data structures and algorithms 
2. OOPs and Resume 
3. System design interview (for Optiver, which was a complete surprise for me but you better be prepared)


##  Preparation Resources
Codeforces, Atcoder, GFG, Leetcode, Brainstellar, 50 challenging problems, A guide to Quantitative finance 

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1. Try to be patient and sit tight, you will see people getting shortlisted and your name not in the list even when you expect it to be, don't loose hope.
2. Don't write SQL in your resume if you don't know it inside out. What I mean is if you are mentioning use of any technology in your resume then expect questions on it.
3. Look at what the company does before the interview and make sure to ask questions to the interviewer after the interview about his experiences, work life, what you will be working on, etc.
