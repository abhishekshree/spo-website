insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
GIVA- Operations

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Aptitude Test
Prepare puzzles and all through interview but and give
some additional aptitude tests on google or practice CAT
Questions (6-7 papers) {keeping in mind the time}-
Mathematical Problems, Data Interpretation, Basic English
aptitude questions
2. ESO202A- Medium Level for the Test, Thermodynamics
(Medium Level Questions), ESO205A Topics. General
question related to Materials and metallurgy
3. GD- Have a Practice through Mocks with friends or
organised by AnC and SPO. My Topic was “Should
Moonlighting be legal in India?” . I would recommend you
to be polite, not over power others, don’t convert it to a
debate. Go through topics of GD {during prep time, fir 5-10
mins something} on Google and read points under them .
Work on your communication skills.
4. HR Round- Started with 1 minute of brief Introduction of
me and my resume, Questions on POR and Projects.
Strengths and Weakness. General HR questions
5. Prepare through questions available on google.
I recommend you to know about the company- what do they

do , what they provide etc you can read about past
interviews on quora or ask some seniors recruited in same
company last year before Interview and GD.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
-Don’t Just Prepare for one profile and be ready for Multiple Profiles
-Be Honest with the Resume, start preparing it beforehand.
-Consult with as many seniors as much as you can under the same profile , don&#39;t be shy
asking your doubts.
