Faheem Nizar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a B.Tech student in Electrical Engineering will do
his summer internship in Data Analytics (Credit and Fraud Risk) profile at American Express. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
nan

## Insights on the Selection Process
The analytics test for Amex was among the more easier tests that we
had to give. This gives an opportunity for all students to get shortlisted,
as most students can easily score quite well in the tests. Amex comes
after a main cohort of companies come together in the so-called “Day
1”, so most of the students will have a good idea of how to appear for
the tests properly.
For the interview selection, there were most likely more factors than just
the test scores. So resume will definitely play a role here. Try to do one
project/internship for keeping your chances towards the safe side. It is
not necessary to be an expert in ML/AI, as I myself didn’t have any

projects in that domain.
During the interview, make sure you are calm and confident. The
interviewers are very friendly and try to make you comfortable. Make
sure you answer all the questions without self-doubt. Also make sure
you have thoroughly gone through each and every point of your
resume. They will enquire deeply to a particular point if its relevant to
the role.

##  Preparation Resources
 50 challenging problems in probability
 Andrew Ng course on Basics of Machine learning
 Try a few case study problems (completely optional)
Nothing much else in terms of resources.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
The interview is mostly HR related, so having a good speaking skill will be very helpful for the
process. Speaking with confidence, and owning your words is also important to them, so be
mindful of what you reply.
Going through your resume is very important. Make sure you know all the points in there, and
try not to fumble on any of the points.

The internship season is undeniably a very stressful period. But make sure you don’t stress
out before of during the interview. Clear your mind for at least 2 hours prior. Speak with
delight and stay calm. Enjoy the process, as many opportunities will come in your way.
