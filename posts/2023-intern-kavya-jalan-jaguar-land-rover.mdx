Kavya Jalan, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in CSE will do
his summer internship in SDE profile at Jaguar Land Rover. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Amex- analytics,Kivi Capitals,Edelweiss,Instabase,Slice,Amazon,JLR,Qube Research
 ORACLE

## Insights on the Selection Process
3 roles, MECH/EV/SDE.
TECHINAL TESTS FOR EACH.
COMMON APTITUDE FOR ALL.
SHORTLISTED STUDENTS HAD JUST ONE ROUND OF
INTERVIEW WITH 2 INTERVIEWERS
INTERVIEW BEGAN WITH MY INTRO, FOLLOWED BY A
CONVERSATION ON MY PROJECT MENTIONED IN MY RESUME.
I WAS THEN ASKED TO CODE A QUESTION ON MAX-SUM
SUBARRAY. THAT IS A STANDARD PROBLEM.
THEN THEY ASKED ME SOME CODING QUESTIONS VERBALLY
LIKE HOW TO INDENTIFY CYCLICAL GRAPH AND LINKED LIST.
AT THE END, THEY ASKED ME SOME COMMON HR QUESTIONS
LIKE WHY I WANTED TO JOIN JLR, MY SHORT/LONG TERM
GOALS.
THAT’S IT! I HAD AN OFFER POST THIS.

##  Preparation Resources
THOSE PROVIDED BY SPO FOR CODING.
RESOURCES LIKE GFG, INTERVIEWBIT, BRAINSTELLAR, STRIVER SHEET, 50CP IF
TIME PERMITS ETC.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
ALL YOU NEED TO GET A GOOD INTERN IS PROPER CODING AND PUZZLE SOLVING
SKILLS. AND THAT CAN BE ACHIVED BY INTENSIVE PRACTICE MAINLY IN THE
SUMMERS. NOTHING MUCH CAN BE REALLY DONE REGARDING CPI, DEPARTMENT.
SO, YOU NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT IT.
REJECTIONS CAN BE DISAPPOINTING (I GOT REJECTED 8 TIMES) BUT IT’S A REALITY
CHECK ABOUT WHERE YOU NEED TO IMPROVE. STAY CALM AND PATIENT. UTILISE
TIME EFFECTIVELY DURING THE SUMMERS.
PUT ENOUGH EFFORTS IN MAKING YOUR RESUME. IT IS IMPORTANT.
ALL THE BEST!
