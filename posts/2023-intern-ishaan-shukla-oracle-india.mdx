Dos
Don’t lose hope
If you are not good at coding don’t start from codeforces rather start from some basic
problems
Find what suits you not what your friends suggests you
If you are not able to do question, learn that Algorithm.
Don’ts
Do theory and questions simultaneously. Don’t wait for doing theory first and then questions.
Don’t waste summer
