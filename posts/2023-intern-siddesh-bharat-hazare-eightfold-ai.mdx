Siddesh Bharat Hazare, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in AE will do
his summer internship in Engineering – Intern (Member of Technical Staff) profile at EightFold AI. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
None

## Insights on the Selection Process
I had two technical rounds and one HR round. In first technical round I was asked question on stack, tree and graphs. In second technical round I was asked about my team, which is Team humanoid,  it's project, it's working and questions on implementation of stack using linked list. Also I was asked about my favourite platform to which I answered linkedIn, then a follow up question about it's implementation and further questions on that. I was also asked about database and sql to which I replied: I don't know. In HR round I was the below questions:
1. Why do you applied for eightflod.ai?
2. What do you liked about the firm?
3. Do you know about the recent developments about the company?
4. You are not from computer science background, why should we hire you?

All rounds were around 50 mins with 10-15mins break in between them, I tried to engage the interviewer as long as I can.

##  Preparation Resources
I started doing DSA when my summer term just began. I used only InterviewBit to practice DSA questions, followed Aditya Verma's Recursion and Dynamic Programming playlist to get used to thinking while solving questions of the respective topics. And read geeks for geeks articles to get used to the further concepts and to clear any doubts. I consulted resources from some seniors too for specific topics and that helped me a lot. Asked doubts to my friends.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
My advice would be to start little early, I started late. Students who start their preparation early are more likely to get good hold over the concepts of DSA. Don't get bogged down by the previous year intern stats of your branch, if you have the required skills you will be definitely getting an internship. Have faith in yourself, that's the most important thing in the whole process. It's important that you don't talk gibberish if you don't know a particular thing, just say I don't know. Talk to as many seniors you want, that will help you in getting a broader perspective about the particular roles you are targeting.
