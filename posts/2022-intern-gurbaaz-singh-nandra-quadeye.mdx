## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do:

● Sitting for non-core/software roles, coding preparation, without any doubt, is a must.
Utilize the summers well and be consistent in solving questions on coding platforms.

● Put a bit of work daily on improving your communication skills. There is no fun if you
know the solution to an XYZ technical/HR question but fail to communicate it
effortlessly to the interviewer.

● Start working on building your resume and reviewing it from seniors early. Else it
unnecessary creates last-minute panic.

Don’t:

● Waste time in comparing yourself to others and looking down upon yourself. Rather
focus on your own growth and efforts.

● Pull other legs down or demotivate others. Intern/placement times could be
overwhelming to one’s physical and mental health, and you should rather be
supporting and motivating others than making fun of their misery.
