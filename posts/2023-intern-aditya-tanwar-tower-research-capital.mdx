Aditya Tanwar , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Quantitative Trading Intern profile at Tower Research Capital. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver- SDE and Quant, Jane Street, Glean US and India, Alphagrep- Software, Graviton- Quant, Quadeye- Quant and System, DE Shaw, Goldman Sachs

## Insights on the Selection Process
Tower Research Capital: A mix of CS fundamentals, algorithmic questions and puzzles were asked in the interview which lasted for about 1.5 hours.

Optiver: You cannot really prepare fully for the interviews, but the interviews for quant role are based on market making (you'll be introduced to the topic at a suitable time by the company itself) and probability (expectation to be precise). You should become fluent in the terminology used in market making for quant interviews/ group discussions and also be prepared to make approximations under time pressure. For the SDE interviews, system design is helpful.

Jane Street: The initial rounds are based on expectation, you don't have to find the exact value. Most of the time, a qualitative analysis will do. The final round is a bunch of interactive games on market making and probability. In the final interview, there are 3 rounds which take around 4 hours in total.

Alphagrep: The topics of questions asked ranged from C++ syntax (because I was more comfortable in C++ than Java) to OOPs to algorithmic questions (some of them required theoretical arguments, others were about implementation) similar to those asked on codeforces/interviewbit. A lot of questions were asked in an interview that lasted for 1.5-2 hours.

Quadeye: In the systems role, some puzzles were asked in the first round. The second round was mostly OOPs and syntax of C++.

##  Preparation Resources
I focused on CP (InterviewBit), puzzles (Brainstellar and GfG), and probability (50 challenging problems, CS203, some common problems like coupon collector, ballot problem, etc.) because I wanted to prepare for Quant and SDE roles. I used to switch between InterviewBit and Brainstellar to prevent the process from being monotonic.
The test series by SPO and PClub were helpful in CP, and the DSA timeline provided by SPO especially helped prepare in a structured way.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1. Have a plan for your preparation. Don't waste your time preparing for roles that you're not interested in.
2. Doing interviewbit is strongly recommended because it helps both in the coding tests as well as the interviews. Often, questions are asked directly from interviewbit.
3. Finish your preparation/revision strictly before the tests begin, you will not be getting time to prepare afterwards because of the hectic schedules of the tests.
4. Keep your health the first priority.
5. For software roles (and even some quant roles) being familiar with OOPs along with keywords/syntax is very beneficial (at least in one language, C++ recommended) because questions are often asked about them.
6. If there is a clash between two interviews, make sure to give the one whose role you prefer more. Do NOT postpone a more preferred role/company for later.
