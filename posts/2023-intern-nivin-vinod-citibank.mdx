## Insights on the Selection Process
For your resume to get shortlisted by Citibank you need to have some
project, or an internship related to finance. When I say finance, it could
be some project on Fundamental Analysis of Companies, Market
Analysis, Mergers and Acquisitions, Fund and Risk Management etc.
In the GD round, everyone who had the bare minimum knowledge
about the sector were shortlisted. It is best if you speak about the
economic and financial side of things because it leaves a good
impression.
In my first round of Interview, I was asked what exactly an Investment
Banker does and why I want to pursue a career in Investment Banking.
I was then asked a few questions on the project “Mergers and
Acquisitions” offered by Finance and Analytics club. The interviewer
asked me if I knew any recent M&amp;A’s and what were its implications.
Then he proceeded to ask me a hypothetical scenario where Jio
acquires BSNL. Although I had answered some possible “synergies”
possible, they were mainly judging my thought process and how I was
able to arrive at a conclusion.I was then called for my second round of Interview. This round was a bit more technical. The interviewer asked me if I knew the 3 financial
statements required to analyze a company. He then asked me a few
questions about the project “Markowitz Portfolio Management”. Then he
took up the topic of M&amp;A’s and asked me how I went about doing the
project. He saw that I had highlighted “DCF Valuation” on my resume
and to test my concepts as well as knowledge on macroeconomics, he
asked “How will the investors of a company react if the RBI increases
the repurchase rate? Could you explain it using DCF valuation?” This
question was a bit difficult, but the interviewer guided me, and I gave a
satisfactory answer.
The final HR round was a mere formality and asked me questions on
why Investment Banking, and what are my strengths etc. No one was
rejected in the HR round.

##  Preparation Resources
Be crystal clear on the projects you have done. Read up on Macroeconomics a week or two
before Citibank arrives for recruitment. If you wish to study M&amp;A, use the book by Donald M
Depamphilis.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do not keep Finance as your first option without exploring other options. Make sure you have
explored all the other options and then decided on finance. Since the number of companies
recruiting for finance roles are very less, please be sure to have a backup option.
