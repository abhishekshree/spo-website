Adarsh kumar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in EE will do
his summer internship in EV Powertrain Intern profile at Jaguar Land rover India Limited. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
KLA Tencor, Qualcomm, Eversana(consulting)

## Insights on the Selection Process
Most questions were from EE250. They asked very fundamental questions which were not taught in course but were related to practical implementation. They also asked questions from the ML project that I had done earlier along with some fundamental concepts from
EE210.
They expect clarity in the fundamental concepts.

##  Preparation Resources
I had revised important concepts from previous courses like ESC201, EE250, EE210.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Prepare core electrical courses well. It will be helpful to do a quick revision of EE250 before interview. Have clarity and confidence about the reason behind every concept taught during course. Be ready to defend every point related to project work mentioned in the resume.
