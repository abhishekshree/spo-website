Aryan Vora , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Consulting profile at Bain & Company. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Quadeye Quant, Graviton Quant, Microsoft ML

## Insights on the Selection Process
For Consulting, prepare for typical HR questions well, know why you are choosing that particular company, and even why you are attracted to consulting in the first place.
Be very strong in cases and guesstimates, and expect unconventional cases from Partners. Have very strong communication skills, and ask all questions no matter how stupid you think they are. Stand strong for the recommendations you make and provide justifications if the interviewer attacks your recommendations. Think out loud and make sure the interviewer knows what you are thinking.

For Quant, practice a lot of probability and puzzles. Interviews are usually short and ask somewhere between 3 to 5 questions.

For ML, revise the common ML algorithms, and how when you can use them. Be well versed with the projects on your resume. Also go through various data manipulation techniques that are used in ML applications.

##  Preparation Resources
For Quant, use Brainstellar and 50 Problems in Probability.
For Consult follow Case Interview Cracked, Case in Point and IIMA Handbook. Also, form a great friend circle for Case-prep with like minded people.
For ML, know the ins and outs of the projects you have worked on and know basic algorithms, their drawbacks and their pros. Basic DSA always helps.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Always have a backup in a different profile if your primary profile doesn't work out for you. 
Also, be calm throughout the preparation process and even during the interviews.
