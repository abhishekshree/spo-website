Alok Kumar Thakur , studying in IIT Kanpur as a Double major student in AE will do
his summer internship in SDE Intern profile at Amazon. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Microsoft, American Express, Kivi Capital, Oracle

## Insights on the Selection Process
There was only one interview round (technical) for Amazon. I was asked for my introduction, then 2 coding problems and 2 short answer questions. First Coding Problem - 'You are given two sticks of some given length. You can break each of these sticks into as many pieces as you want. Finally you have to choose 4 sticks of equal length out of all those sticks and form a square. You have to report the side length of the maximum area square which you can from.' Second Coding Problem - 'Find the maximum path sum between any two leaf nodes in a binary tree'. Then I was asked about the definitions of postorder and inorder traversal of a binary tree.

##  Preparation Resources
I did coding on Competitive coding websites like 'Codeforces' and 'Codechef', but mainly on Codeforces. I also practiced from Interviewbit. 'Puzzles' as well as 'Programming' section of Interviewbit helped a lot.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
My advice to students sitting for internship next year would be to thoroughly complete each and every problem from Interviewbit (Programming and Puzzles sections). And also learn about Object Oriented Programming. It would be good if you have knowledge of the following 3 languages - C++, Java and Python. For Quant profiles, you should do Interviewbit puzzles and Brainstellar compulsorily. Additionally, you could also solve the book named '50 Challenging Problems'.
