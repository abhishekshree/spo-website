Harsh Jain , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in R&D Associate profile at Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
nan

## Insights on the Selection Process
Only one Question from Strings and some projects from my resume were discussed in the technical interview.
Theoretical knowledge of DSA is a good thing to have for smooth technical interview process.
Just be confident and never give one word answers. It's not an objective Question paper which would have a binary answer. Always try to express your answer as a story.

##  Preparation Resources
I used GFGs for preparing the base. It has the collection of all standard problems and algorithms.
InterviewBit to practice for coding tests and interviews. 
I used Brainsteller to prepare for Quant profiles.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Do CP to clear coding tests and have some good knowledge of DSA for clearing interviews. A course on probability is a good thing for Quant profiles. And try to maintain a good CPI ( it will have only good side effects:)
