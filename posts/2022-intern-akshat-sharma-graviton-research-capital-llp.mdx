Akshat Sharma, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Software Engineering profile at Graviton Research Capital LLP. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Quadeye (Software engineering intern), Optiver (Software engineering intern)

## Insights on the Selection Process
The Graviton interview involved 2 coding questions. The first used trees and recursion, the second was quite unique and based on discrete mathematics. No questions from dynamic programming/graphs were asked. 

The second round of the graviton interview involved a lot of questions from computer organisation (CS220). They asked questions based on memory management(about heap,stack, global pointer memory allocation), how the memory stack is maintained in programs(they gave an example program and asked me how the stack would be arranged), pipelining, hazards related to pipelining.

The last question was a practical one based on how cache misses and branch prediction influence performance and how to write code that keeps these points in mind. Most of the above points are covered in CS220 (other than the pratical aspects of writing code)

##  Preparation Resources
1.) For Coding practice : Interviewbit(website), Geeks for geeks(website). 

2.) For Algorithms theory : Introduction to algorithms by Cormen. 

3.) For Probability : CS203 course slides, Brainstellar(website).

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Start preparing at the start of your summers. Try to identify which profiles are of your interest. Get your resume checked with atleast 5 seniors. If applying for high frequency trading profiles then knowledge of the market is a must. Try and be consistent. Be confident and formal during the interview.
