Antreev Singh Brar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Quant Researcher profile at Tower Research Capital. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
N/A

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist: Based on CPI
2. Test: Technical test was taken - OS / Network and CP based questions
3. Interview Process: 2 Rounds of Technical and One small HR round. Both technical rounds revolved around probability , statistics , data structures and puzzles. The HR round was more of like a brainstorming session on dealing with a open ended finance problem. Just like an informal discussion.

The Resume selection criteria for all HFTs is just CPI along with your branch. Its simple as that. So if you are in CSE with 9.5+ , you should get in most HFTs interviews. Tower had a technical test, so you had to perform well in it be shortlisted. Interview rounds were hard, the data structure questions asked could be weighted at about 1900-2000 on codeforces. The probability ones were straight out of CS203 course and 50 interesting problems in statistics book. The informal HR round was fun.

Interview Questions: You have 2 sticks with an error of ‘a%’ and ‘b%’ (while measuring length). What is the minimum percentage in error you can get while measuring the length of the stick formed after joining the two sticks.

##  Preparation Resources

1) Code and improve CPI
2) Don't lose your cool
