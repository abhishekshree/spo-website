Sahil Bansal, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Quant profile at Quadeye Securities . Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
qaunt profile- quantbox, tower research; software profile- samsung korea, spinklr, goldman sachs, morgan stanley

## Insights on the Selection Process
Coding- Mainly graphs, DP, basic arrays.
Puzzles- some were difficult but interviewer gave lots of hint to solve them.
probability- mostly random variables, expectations and PnC

##  Preparation Resources
Started with coding practice on interviewbits. After completing it moved to leetcode to practice important topics such as dynamic programming, graph etc. Then practiced from 50 challenging problems in probability and brainstellar puzzles.
Regularly gave cf contests.

Resources: 
Coding: interviewbits, leetcode, codeforces. For those who  could not do ESO207 learn theory from gfg.
Quant: 50 cpp, brainstellar, Xinfeng Ghou.


## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Please maintain you CPI. If cpi is not good start giving codeforces contest a little early(don't wait for summers, I suggest start at the beginning of 4th sem) and build up your cp skills, you can achieve anything with good cp skills.

Regarding projects/POR, ensure that you have sufficient enough to fill up your resume, in summers your main goal should be cp skills.

For the interviews, ensure that you make it as interactive as possible, the interviewer is their to help you solve the problem, use them and their hints.

For Quant and software roles, HR rounds are not that important.
