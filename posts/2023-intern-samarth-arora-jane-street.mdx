Samarth Arora, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Proprietary Trader  profile at Jane Street. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Tower - Limestone, Tower- Northmoore, Quadeye, Graviton Research Capital, Quantbox, DE Shaw, Glean, Google India,

## Insights on the Selection Process
Questions in quant interviews were mainly puzzles and simple to complicated levels of probability and expectation questions. In SDE interviews the questions were basically involving data structures and various algorithms. There were also some questions on computer architecture in some interviews.

##  Preparation Resources
My preparation of SDE was to finish all questions of InterviewBit. For revision I did some hard questions of Leetcode. For quant prep I did 50 challenging problems in probability, Heard on the Street, Brainstellar, Challenging dice problems.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
If you're sitting for a quant role you need to focus on your CPI and your probability skills. Do various puzzles off brainstellar.com and a really good book is 50 challenging problems of probability. For SDE roles you need to brush upon your data structures. An effecient way to do this is to finish InterviewBit as it has topic wise questions. Read up on GeeksForGeeks for concepts as well.
