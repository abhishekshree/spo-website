##  Preparation Resources
To prepare for internship season, there are two major areas which one needs to practice, CP and Quant.

For CP -
1. Basic - if you are new to coding then first pick up a coding language (preferably C++, read about STL), understand different Data Structures and learn basic algorithms for graphs since
it is one of the favorite topics and build upon it.
2. Advanced – There are different websites where you can practice questions from. I recommend solving Interview Bit since it has many relevant questions. Apart from this I personally used Leetcode during the initial part of preparation and CodeForces towards the end. CP algorithms is a nice resource to widen your coding toolbox.

For Quant –
1. Revision Mso/hso
2. 50 challenging Questions
3. Brain stellar
4. Xinfeng Chau

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
If you fear giving interviews, then make sure you attend the mock interviews organized by both SPO and AnC Council. It is better to form a peer group while solving CP questions daily since there will be someone with whom you can discuss different approaches to solve the same problem. Always remember that interview is not just how much you know, but how much you can reproduce in a pressure situation. Maintain your nerves during the interview. While discussing the problem statement make sure you understand it perfectly, you need to ask the interviewer about the end cases. Think aloud during the interview so that interviewer can get to know the approach you are using. Start making resume at least a month before the submission and get it reviewed by some seniors.
