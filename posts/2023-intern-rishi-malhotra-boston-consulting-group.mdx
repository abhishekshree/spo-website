Rishi Malhotra, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in ME will do
his summer internship in Management Consulting profile at Boston Consulting Group. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Bain and Co.-- Management Consulting ,  Proctor and Gamble-- Manufacturing

## Insights on the Selection Process
I was only asked cases in my interview.

##  Preparation Resources
Consulting
I started with watching a few youtube videos to get a idea of how a case interview is done and how to approach and solve a case. After this you can look up on any case book to practice like the IIMA casebook. You can start by reading a few cases but it is always advised to practice the case along with your friends, one can read up the problem statement while other tries to solve it.

Supply Chain
Not much preparation is required here. You should be well versed with your resume and should have a idea about your core courses, mainly the practical application of these courses is asked in the interview. These companies also take a Group Discussion round, you can even practice these with your group of friends and can call and senior to act up as the moderator.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Be confident with what you say in the interview, if you don’t know the answer do not
fool around, and politely refuse.
Don't rely on last minute preparation.
