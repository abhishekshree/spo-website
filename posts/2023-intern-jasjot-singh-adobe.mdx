Jasjot Singh, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Research Intern profile at Adobe. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver (Quant), Quadeye, Goldman Sachs, Sprinklr, WorldQuant, Edelweiss

## Insights on the Selection Process
For Adobe, my interview was based on discussing projects mentioned in the resume,gauging my interest in research and one quant problem - Monty Hall
In quant firms apart from Optiver, the questions are mostly based on the resources mentioned above or slight variations of them.
For software roles, I was asked theoretical questions on Object Oriented Programming and mostly variations of standard problems (Stacks and Queues, Heaps, Graphs). I was asked to implement some standard data structures such as Vectors and Strings as classes.
Optiver has a very different interview process which invovles mental math and market making so it's a bit hard to prepare for that.

##  Preparation Resources
For Quant preparation -  50 challenging problems in probability, Brainstellar, Xinfeng Zhou (problems might overlap in the last two but the book has very good explanations of problems, so do read the first 5 chapters)
For SDE - InterviewBit/LeetCode for practice (stick with one platform only and I feel InterviewBit is concise and has a good set of questions which cover most of the stuff)
GeeksForGeeks and InterviewBit resources for theory

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
It's very important to know your resume inside out, especially for projects. I had a few rounds where I was grilled for half an hour just on one project which they liked.
For people targeting software role, do study OOPs seriously because a lot of MCQs or theoretical questions are asked in the tests and interviews.
Also, try to understand how some major data structures are implemented in the programming language.
For quant roles, CPI plays a major role in certain firms so do your best to work on that
