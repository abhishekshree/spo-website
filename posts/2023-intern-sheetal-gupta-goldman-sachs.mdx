Sheetal Gupta , studying in IIT Kanpur as a B Tech student in EE will do
her summer internship in Summer Intern- Investment Banking profile at Goldman Sachs . Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Uber-SDE
● Sprinklr-SDE
● MS-SDE

## Insights on the Selection Process
Microsoft - I was asked a standard problem of LCA but the difference being u cannot traverse the whole tree so I needed to apply dfs on trees. 

Uber- In round 1 I was asked one question on arrays.
In round 2 I was asked three questions on strings which I solved using unordered maps.
Questions being: Given an array of strings and a given string find if the given string is a prefix of any, Given a string find the total count of strings whose reverse exist in the string, Given a string find the total count of each string whose reverse exist after the current string ends(no overlaps).
I was asked to implement all the three.
The HR round was majorly about me and my projects. At the end he gave me a problem to design a lift in a building using class.

Goldman Sachs- In round 1 I was asked standard problems on probability and statistics like find the expected number of rolls of a dice to see all 6 faces and same for a coin.
An ant is moving on the edges of a unit square find the expected number of steps to reach the opposite end.
In round 2 I was given a problem where 10 billion points were to be stored using only 100,000 available spaces dynamically. I was asked to write an algorithm such that at the end the probability to store each point becomes equal 
Round 3 was based on my resume, projects and DSA problems.I was asked to suggest a data structure which could reduce the time complexity to send connection request on LinkedIn. And an algorithm to find friends of friends in minimum time possible.

##  Preparation Resources
In my prephase preparation I have multiple contests over codeforces from January to May hence I was pretty good at topics like arrays and strings so I didn't covered it from interview bit.
I have rigorously followed Interview bit for the start of my preparation. Covered topics like trees, linked list, heaps and maps, stacks and queues completely from there.
Practiced important topics like D.P and graphs from leetcode and CSES. For covering all the standard problems of graphs CSES is the best website I have found 


## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Prepare well before the intern season. Decide your field and use these 2 months to prepare well. Talk to seniors, utilise your time and be focused only on the sectors you want to focus on. Most importantly keep faith in yourself.
