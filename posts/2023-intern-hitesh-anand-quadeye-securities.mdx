Hitesh Anand, studying in IIT Kanpur as a CSE student in nan will do
his summer internship in Quant profile at Quadeye Securities. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Quadeye(Systems), Tower Research Capital(Quant), Samsung Korea (Core/Research), Microsoft (Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
I had four interviews in total on Day-1. Two (Tower and Quadeye) were offline and the rest (Samsung and Microsoft) were online.

Tower Research : I was asked questions from probability and some puzzles. The problems were really tricky and they really took a lot of time and thinking. I think doing the last 15-20 questions from 50 CP and hard problems from Brainstellar properly might give you some exposure to the level of questions asked here. Though, I still feel the level of questions was slightly more difficult. For example, one of the questions was based on a slight modification of Minimum Spanning Tree.

Quadeye : There were four rounds. In the first three rounds, they asked some probability questions and puzzles. The topics covered expected values, mean, variance of probability distributions, puzzles, etc. The difficulty was that of Brainstellar Easy+Medium, and 50 CP. The questions were quite interesting, but not that difficult. Some of the questions were: 1. find the 80th percentile element in an unsorted array in linear time, 2. A 6-sided fair dice is rolled n times, define a random variable Xi to denote the number of times the ith face showed up, then find the covariance of X1 and X2, 3. Estimate the sum of the square root of first 49 natural numbers, etc. 

Samsung Korea : This was a very smooth experience (except for the miserable internet connection). I was first sent to the HR round. They asked me about my future goals and why did I apply for Samsung, and similar questions. It went on for about 20-25 minutes. Next, there was a small technical round where I was asked questions about my resume(my projects and internship experience), and a question from String manipulation (easy one). 

Microsoft : There were two rounds. Both were related to DSA. Some questions were easy and some were tricky. The questions were : 1. Second smallest element in array, 2. find the peak element in an array (and some variations), and 3. A string pattern matching question based on KMP algorithm (slight variation).

##  Preparation Resources
For the SDE role, I focused mainly on competitive programming and DSA. I didn't have much CP experience at the start of my preparation. I started focusing on CP properly after the beginning of my 4th sem. I tried to solve 1-2 problems daily from the codeforces problem set. I started covering topic-wise DSA from interviewbit. It took me around one month to complete all the topics properly. I also took notes of the topics and questions where I was stuck which were quite helpful at the time of revision. I was also regular in giving the contests on Codeforces and Codechef. Besides this, I also participated in some of the contests organized by Pclub. Contests really helped me improve my CP skills and solve problems in limited time. But, first learn properly about C++ STL from any online source (GFG preferably) before solving harder problems. So to summarize, Codeforces + Interviewbit + Proper revision of DSA should be enough to do better in Coding rounds and Interviews as far as SDE roles are concerned. I was done with all this one week before the tests started. Hence, I solved some problems from Leetcode Hard as well but that's completely optional if you have done rest of the things mentioned above properly.

For the Quant roles, I covered 50 Challenging Problems, Brainstellar, Cut-the-knot problemset, and Xinfeng Zhou's Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews. Before solving questions, ensure that you have revised the basic probability concepts such as Expected values, means, variance, probability distributions, Geometric Probability, etc. These topics are covered in the Probability courses such as CS203 or MSOs. The order of solving problems was as follows : 50 CP -> Brainstellar -> Xinfeng Zhou -> Cut-the-knot. You need not solve all of them. Just solve 50 CP and brainstellar properly (atleast twice). Then, move to the last two if you have time. You need not have a good knowledge of finance or markets beforehand.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Maintain your CPI (the most important advice) and improve your problem-solving skills. Most of the coding tests require decent CP skills for you to get shortlisted. Hence, along with Interviewbit/Leetcode, also invest some time on solving problems from Codeforces/giving contests. The earlier you start, the better you get at this. Be consistent. Another important thing that most people overlook is that you have to maintain your temperament throughout. At times, you might feel quite nervous and frustrated. You will want the process to end as soon as possible. Avoid this sort of thinking. In your free time, do breathing exercises, meditate for a while, exercise. In the summers, try to get a project/internship which doesn't affect your preparation too much. During the summers, try to fix your routine and devote a fixed amount of time to preparation consistently. Maintain your health and stay calm even if you get an unexpected result. Stay calm, maybe there is something better waiting for you at the end :)
