Anmol Pabla, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in ME will do
his summer internship in Strats and Quant profile at Morgan Stanley. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Quadeye (Systems), Quantbox (Software), Sprinklr, Goldman Sachs

## Insights on the Selection Process
The interview with Morgan Stanley involved questions on probability concepts like the Bayes theorem. I was also asked a couple of programming questions in the first round, I didn't have to code them but had to explain the approach to be taken. The second round invloved puzzles and questions on statistics and probability. The two rounds were then followed by a short HR round. You might not be able to solve the question in the first go, try to explain your approach and take the hints that the interviewer gives you.

Questions:- 
Finding Median of two sorted arrays after combining them.
No. of Rectangles and squares in a chess board.
Effect of skewness on measures of central tendency of a standard normal distribution.

##  Preparation Resources
I prepared for Software roles by practicing on websites like LeetCode and InterviewBit. Having good knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms is always a plus. One should always try to solve questions in a timed manner.
For quant profiles, Brainstellar and 50 challenging problems in probability are a must, questions in interviews are often extracted from concepts present in the questions on these websites.  

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Start your preparation early and spend time on making a resume. Before the interviews prepare your resume well enough to answer any questions about it. 

And the most important thing in times like these is to always keeping your morale up.
