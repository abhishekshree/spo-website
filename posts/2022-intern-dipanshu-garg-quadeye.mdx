Dipanshu Garg, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Systems profile at Quadeye. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Graviton, Alphagrep, DE Shaw, Rubrik, Google, Sprinkler, GS

## Insights on the Selection Process
Topics - Data Structures and Algorithms, OOP, Probability

Company specific shortlisting:

1.) HFTs software - (Highly) biased towards high CPI. Some don't even conduct tests. Tests are of moderate difficulty.

2.) Rubrik - Shortlisting purely based on coding test. Quality of questions is really good. You should be comfortable with solving A/B/C/D problems in a CF Div 2 round.

3.) Google - Resume shortlisting + test. Do participate in Kickstart/Codejam. If you secure good ranks in them, mention them on your resume as it is a big plus.

Interviews:

1.) HFTs software - Besides DSA, they might expect some knowlege of OOP preferably in C++.

2.) Rubrik - Similar to test just in a different format.

3.) Google - Tricky DSA problems. Also you need to code in a google doc.

##  Preparation Resources
Codeforces, InterviewBit, Leetcode, Fifty challenging problems in Probability

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Try to maintain a good CPI. Also start preparation early.
