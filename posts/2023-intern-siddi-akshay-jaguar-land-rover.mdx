Siddi Akshay , studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in MTH will do
his summer internship in Software Developer profile at Jaguar Land Rover. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
nan

## Insights on the Selection Process
They asked anagram of two strings and give better optimisation,different types of traversals in trees along with examples.
Later that they quite a lot about C++ related questions like what’s the difference between Interpretor,Compiler and what’s better between them.They asked me source code definition and time value and they showed me a code related to that. They asked me if it’s front-end or back-end for code written about car, and what’s the difference between.Like mostly DBMS.
As for HR
They asked me a lot of teamwork related questions and asked me why am I passionate about coding like what me attracted to it since I told them so many passionate things about coding/software.
They asked me about python and what would you use python for? And why C++? Differentiate them.
Why choose JLR?
They asked me about some DBMS I don’t know and even OOP’s.I simply answered them that I didn’t come across this question nor did I cover OOPs in my curriculum.

##  Preparation Resources
Gfg,interviewbit and study about which language you are going for details a lot like for C++ do read about namespace, source value and time stuff related

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Be cool and confident in interview and do your DSA well and thorough.Do study about DBMS and if they ask some questions you don’t know, just tell them you didn’t cover it yet.Don’t sugarcoat in interview, be honest about your resume. Be more passionate and give appropriate HR answers and make the company itself and yourself stand out during your speech like what makes this company different from other companies.If you do that, they will eventually start to like you and ask you more questions.
Do quite a research about company and what makes them special and different so that it will help you in interview and find some interesting to ask at the end of interview to prove that you are interested and did a research about this company.
At the end of interview, I asked them about JLR and NVIDIA collaboration since NVIDIA is providing automation test to JLR by 2023, so I asked what will SDE do then if NVIDIA is aiding?
It’s okay if you don’t get it, it’s not the end of the world there’s other more companies to try, just never give up :)
