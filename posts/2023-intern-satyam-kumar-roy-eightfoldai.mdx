Satyam Kumar Roy, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in MTH will do
his summer internship in SDE profile at Eightfold.ai. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Eightfold.ai (SDE)
● Sprinklr (SDE)

## Insights on the Selection Process
Most companies use CPI and Branch as selection criteria for their
coding exam shortlists.

##  Preparation Resources
I didn’t prepare explicitly for interviews. I used to attempt contests on Codeforces,
Codechef, and Atcoder. It helped me in clearing the coding tests. In interviews, I was
mainly asked about coding problems.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Try to maintain decent CPI. Be fluent with the projects mentioned in the resume. Don’t
rush during the interviews. Take your time and answer the questions with a calm mind.
