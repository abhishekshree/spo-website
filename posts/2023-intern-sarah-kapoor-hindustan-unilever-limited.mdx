Sarah Kapoor, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CHE will do
her summer internship in ULIP- Supply Chain Intern (Techno-Managerial) profile at Hindustan Unilever Limited. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
ITC, HUL (received offers from both)

## Insights on the Selection Process
In the final interview, you will be asked several questions in your resume. The interviewer can pick up any single line from the CV and grill you on it. Apart from this, you will be asked a few technical questions. Mostly, you will be offered a choice of your favourite course, and then they’ll ask you questions from that. Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics are the courses that are generally asked. Don’t dive too deep into the subject, because they aren’t going to test you on mathematical formulae. Just be clear with the basic concepts. Important topics include pumps, motors, generators, thermodynamic cycles, laws of thermodynamics, basic equations of Fluid Mechanics and the likes of these. 

##  Preparation Resources
HUL and ITC interviews primarily grill you on each and every point of your resume, so be thorough with every single word. You will be asked questions on your projects, PORs, and internships, if you have any. 

Both HUL and ITC have a resume-based form, which they use for shortlisting. After that-

1. ITC has a GD round. Read up on the basic etiquette on how you should conduct yourself in the GD. Practice the AnC GDs and you should be good. 

2. HUL has an online video interview round, on the HireVue platform. You basically will be asked around 3 questions, which will be short case studies of sorts, with a set time limit for each, and you need to record yourself while speaking the answer and submit it. You get one attempt per question. For this, you can prepare by reading up on what supply chain actually is, what are the challenges faced in the supply chain and FMCG industry, and what are the best practices to be adopted to improve the industry. You can also read up on the different technologies used in supply chain. 

After these rounds, the final shortlist for the interviews is released, wherein you will be asked resume-based, as well as technical questions. 

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Just be confident, and extremely thorough with your preparation, especially the CV. Do not lose your nerve if you do not know something in the interview, keep calm and give your best shot!
