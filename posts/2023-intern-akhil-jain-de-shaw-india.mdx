Akhil Jain, studying in IIT Kanpur as a B.Tech student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Technical Developer profile at DE Shaw India. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● DE Shaw (Technology
Developer)
● Optiver (Software/Quant)
● Graviton(Quant)

## Insights on the Selection Process
DE Shaw looks for the individuals who have good problem solving
skills. Even if you are not good at CP, they look more towards your
approach to a problem, your creativity in the solution. As the projects on
your resume and courses such as DSA are the only signs of your
coding experience, they question you heavily on the resume. They also
test your sincerity towards your work based on your answers to these
questions.
They want efficient solutions and that’s why much focus is on the
optimization problems w.r.t both memory and time.

##  Preparation Resources
1. LeetCode Explore Cards for studying DSA concepts
2. Interviewbit Programming Questions along with LeetCode Easy/Medium Questions
3. Aditya Verma 50 DP problems playlist
4. After completing Interviewbit, LeetCode Hard questions for Graph and DP practice

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do’s
1.) Even if you haven’t studied DSA, it is quite possible that through regular practice in
these 2.5 months, you can crack the coding questions of most companies. So, do
utilise it tu the fullest.
2.) At first build your base in C++ STL. Get comfortable with vectors, pairs at first , solve
the questions on Interviewbit and LeetCode. Then move further as per the SPO
schedule.
3.) Maintain a notebook to note the questions which you found tricky and difficult. Note the
question and its approach after coding the solution. It is going to be highly useful in
July end when you will need to revise all the 400-500 questions you have solved.
4.) Make interview 2-way communication. Don’t hesitate to tell your approach(even if
wrong) to the interviewers. They will try to correct you with hints.
5.) Any firm will look for your interest in the firm. Most of the interviewers are firm
employees, so try to build a bond with them by taking their introduction, what work
they do in the firm and what they expect from you as a candidate. Don’t forget to ask
about the interview feedback at the end. These things will leave a positive impact on
them after the interview.
6.) In last few days, solve random questions using a timer and note the time taken.

Don’ts

1.) Don’t take a long leave from coding in the summer if you are a beginner.
2.) Never boast in front of an interviewer about your skills and abilities. Don’t
exaggerate them. It makes a negative impact about your attitude and honesty.
