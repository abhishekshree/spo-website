Kushal Gehlot, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Software Intern profile at APT Portfolio. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
NK Securities

## Insights on the Selection Process
APT Portfolio:
There was a technical test round. It consisted OOPs(kind of subjective where you had to explain the output) and 2 coding questions(little different from other coding rounds). Followed by it, there were 2 rounds of technical interview. In round 1, I was first asked about a particular project in my resume, followed by some conceptual questions in C++ like difference between unordered and ordered maps, diff between new and malloc, etc. Then there were 2 coding question, where I had to write complete code on the ide. Coding questions were easy and I was able to do that comfortably. In the next round, I was asked coding questions  

Special Tip: PLEASE DO OOPs questions, you can find all concepts on various websites. I would suggest do interviewbit oops questions and concepts. This is in general, many companies had some questions of OOPs, mostly in the form of MCQs or predicting outputs.

For quant tests, it was mostly brainstellar and 50 challenging probs book. During the interview, the questions were good and you had to think solution or strategy instantly, I had not seen those questions before.

##  Preparation Resources
I started preparing during the summers. For software roles, I solved Interviewbit covering essential data structures and algorithms. I think graphs and trees is most important topic(many of them say its DP but in my case maximum companies had graphs more than DP !). Try to solve question in programming section of Interviewbit. If you are unable to solve a question, do see the solution rather just skipping it. You never know if that question comes in a test or interview !! (happened in my case).
For quant roles I solved brainstellar and 50 Challenging Problems book. I think that covered most of the questions asked in technical tests as well as interviews.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Don't take unnecessary stress and always be optimistic .
Talk to your friends, discuss with them and help them in case if they are facing any problems.
All the best !
