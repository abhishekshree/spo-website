## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Try to stick to a few resources and follow them thoroughly during your preparation. It's always tempting to switch to other resources. But it usually causes mental chaos. Maintaining consistency is key, and while it's important to take breaks, they should be of reasonable length. Short breaks can indeed be beneficial at times, but it's essential to avoid excessively long breaks that might hinder your progress.

The crucial advice for your coding round interview is to refrain from silently solving questions during the session. Always try to speak whatever is coming into your mind. Even if you end up not solving the question, then also you will be able to show your approach to the interviewer.
Consider HR interviews a fun question-answer session rather than some serious business. HR interviewers generally look for how frankly you can communicate with your peers. Always try to give some example from your experience, which can be remotely related to the question, but it still makes a better impact.
