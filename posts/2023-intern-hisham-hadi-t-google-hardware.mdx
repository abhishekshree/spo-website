## Insights on the Selection Process
Google gives high weightage to previous experience in core when
shortlisting candidates for interview. Having core projects or second
year core internships is a positive factor
Google also looks for something they call Googleyness, which is an
indicator of how good a fit the candidate is to the google culture.

##  Preparation Resources
1. Prof. Baquer Mazhari’s lectures for ESC201, available on YouTube
2. HDLbits for Verilog practice
3. PYQs of relevant core courses done in IITK
4. Other youtube lectures and channels like Neso Academy
5. Coding from Interviewbit (mainly for other profiles)

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Dos:
1. Think out loud in interviews. Keep talking through whatever you’re doing to get to the
solution. For the interviewer, how you reached the answer is just as important as the
answer you got.
2. The interviewer is not your opponent. Learn to find cues in what they say, they often
nudge us in the right direction.
Don’ts:
1. Don’t try to answer questions from courses that you haven’t studied. Just tell them and
they will avoid questions from that area.
