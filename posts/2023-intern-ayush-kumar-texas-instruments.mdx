Ayush Kumar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in EE will do
his summer internship in Embedded Software Internship profile at Texas Instruments. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Texas Instruments, Quantbox, Adobe

## Insights on the Selection Process
Open only for CSE & EE. No CPI criteria.
First we had a 30 mins aptitude test followed by embedded software test of 45mins.
You have to score atleast 80-90% combined to get shortlisted for interviews.
The interviewer asked me about the EE courses I have taken and question related to cybersecurity (as i mentioned it in my resume). 
Since, I was not much interested in core, he asked me questions related to cybersecurity, cryptography, hashing algorithms, backprocess of how a C program is executed and some very basic questions related to circuits.
The interview round went around 30-40 mins. I only had one interview round.

##  Preparation Resources
Mostly solved coding problems from interviewbit & cses problem set.
Throughout the summer I solved around 400+ DSA problems and have been doing competitive programming from 3rd semester. 
My CPI was low so I was having a hard time getting shortlisted for many companies. 
I didn't prepared anything specific to core as my main aim was for SDE roles.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Focus on your CPI. No matter which role you want to get it be it software, quant, consulting etc. a good CPI will always give you edge over others in getting shortlisted for technical test/interviews. Once you reach the interview stage it won't be that much of a trobule. 
As for someone who is aming for SDE roles I would suggest to start early and be consistent at it. Start with interviewbit, solve cses problems and give contest regularly. It would be more than sufficient.
