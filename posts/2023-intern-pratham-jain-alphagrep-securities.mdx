Pratham Jain, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Software profile at Alphagrep Securities. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
 Google , Goldman Sachs

## Insights on the Selection Process
Alphagrep -
I was asked OOPS questions, data structure questions and some coding questions in both rounds. Have to code it , interviewer see approach and code is not runned on test cases( common for all interviews).
I have one round of interview followed by another round without break , both of nearly 40 min and then HR round of 5 min, and on spot offer was made.
Google -
Format of google interview is same every year . Only Coding questions are asked in it. Easy version of problem followed by hard version of it. Two rounds of interview and same form.at for each round . Have to code in google doc :|  . Graph and DP are favorite topics of google , and questions of it was asked from my friends and seniors also told that . I was asked array question and greedy question.

General interview tips -
Convey what you are thinking to interviewer clearly while solving problem . Don't be silent for more than 5 minutes. Also , interviewer gives hint if you are on wrong path or stuck at some point , take it. Be confident.

I was not asked resume in any interview , but from some , resume was asked in nearly every interview . Be thoroughly prepared with your resume.

##  Preparation Resources
For Software -
Since , I had already done ESO207 and was also active in CP , I already know the theory part and algorithms commonly used. 
DP, graph, trees are extra things( and most important ones) from ESC101 which may be new to you if you haven't done ESO207.
Sources for these topics , which I personally found nice
DP - topcoder blog
Trees - ESO207 slides
Graph - ESO207 slides, Algorithms by S. Dasgupta, C.H. Papadimitriou, and U.V. Vazirani(chapter on graph)

I solved interviewbit and recommend it to fully solve it .If you do it regularly for two months , it is not a big deal.

Study OOPS from geeks for geeks , will not take much time , can do it summer last

For quant -
Probablilty - For theory , any probability course fine which teaches expectation , conditional probability, bayes theorem , etc. . I did CS203
Questions - Brainstellar, 50 Challenging problems ( some tests and interview have direct questions from here . Very difficult to solve them in given time constraint if you haven't seen them before)
Puzzles - Brainstellar
These things also didn't take much time ,5-6 days more than enough . can do it in summer last.

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Shortlisting for tests is based on CPI .
For day 1. If you are 9+ , then you'll be able to give nearly every company's test. Try to reach 9+ before summers. At 8.5+ too , eligible to give tests for large number of companies.

As intern season progress , CPI bar is lowered by companies and branch restrictions are also relaxed.

If targeting software/quant profile , start with coding from start of summers and be regular.
Initially focus on coding . Quant specific prep and other things don't take much time and can do it at end of summers( 10 days before starting of intern season).
To clear tests  , coding skills is the only key . Improve it as much as possible.

CPI and coding are things which matters most( maybe things which only matters for most companies).
