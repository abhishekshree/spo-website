## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Dos:
 Try giving contest instead of just using platforms like LeetCode and InterviewBit.
 Share as much as possible with the interviewer and tell them everything about your
approach to the problem.
 Stick to the basics, especially when it comes to Microsoft-specific skills.
 Write your code on an IDE, as this will help you to write clean and maintainable code.
 Be confident, positive and enthusiastic throughout the interview.

Don'ts:
 Don't try to do everything by yourself, ask for help and collaborate with the interviewer.
 Don't rush through the problem, take your time and think carefully before implementing
your solution.
 Don't be afraid to ask questions if you are unsure about the problem or the
requirements.
 Don't write code that is difficult to read or understand, as this can create problems later
on.
