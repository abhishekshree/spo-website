Ankit Yadav, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in ME will do
his summer internship in Software Developer profile at D.E Shaw India Pvt Ltd. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
NA

## Insights on the Selection Process
Questions Related to Dynamic Programming, Graphs and Binary search and very basic questions regarding OOPS were asked.

##  Preparation Resources
1. Interview Bit ( Programming and Puzzles)
2. Codeforces( for pclub contests only)
3. CSES Problem Set (to consolidate a topic if enough time is there)
4. Competitive Programming - 3  (BOOK by Steven Halim and Felix Halim)
5. Brainsteller
6. GeeksforGeeks

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
Most important thing is to have good peer group for discussing questions, find people with common interest, keep giving contests organized by pclub and you must keep learning things which you don't know and due to which you were not able to solve a particular question in company tests and contests. My personal advice would be to First do each and every question from Interview Bit and keep learning things you don't know from geeks for geeks, for graphs and Binary search read theory (no need to do questions if you don't have much time) from the book I mentioned(CP-3 by Halim). For DP do every question from Interview Bit and also do some questions from CSES problem set for building confidence, for quant profile do Brainsteller and interview bit Puzzles, if you get stuck refer to GeeksforGeeks for that question and YouTube if still not clear.
