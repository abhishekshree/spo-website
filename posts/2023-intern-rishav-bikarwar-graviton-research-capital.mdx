Rishav Bikarwar, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Software profile at Graviton Research Capital. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Graviton Research Capital
(Quant and Software)
● AlphaGrep (Software)
● QuantBox (Software)
● Goldman Sachs (Software)

## Insights on the Selection Process
During the selection process, the initial resume shortlisting was based
on the CPI. The coding test that followed had a time limit of one hour
and contained questions on topics such as tree traversal and Dynamic
Programming (DP). Additionally, the quantitative aptitude test included
questions on probability and discrete mathematics, with a focus on
evaluating probability using recursion, expected values, and Bayes&#39;
theorem.
The first round of interview involved coding problems. They asked
questions from query data structure and tree operations. The second
round of the interview focused on topics from CS220 (Computer
Organization) such as pipelining, memory management, and stack
manipulation. Overall, the selection process for the software profile was
rigorous, and candidates were expected to have a solid understanding
of both theoretical and practical concepts related to the field.

Sample Interview
/Test Questions

1. A variant of k-sum paths in a binary tree – find number of paths in a
binary tree that has sum k.
2. Find kth largest number in a nxn matrix where each row and column
is sorted in ascending order.
3. Given an array where ith element represents max distance that can
be jumped from that position, find minimum number of jumps needed to

reach last index.

##  Preparation Resources
For Quant – 50 Challenging Problems, Brainstellar
For Coding – Interviewbit, Codeforces, CSES, Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
- Practice coding regularly: Make sure to set aside time each day to work on coding problems,
and don&#39;t be afraid to start small.
- Don&#39;t get discouraged if you&#39;re unable to solve a problem right away. Instead, seek hints and
collaborate with others to work towards a solution. Joining a study group or participating in
Codeforces / Codechef contests can also be a great way to learn from others and build your
skills.
- Attend any mock interviews or practice sessions organized by SPO to gain experience and
get feedback on your performance.
- For quant prep, try to solve probability questions on Bayes theorem and expectations. Solve
the problems from sources mentioned above at least two times.
- Review your resume: Before applying for internships, make sure your resume is polished
and professional. Get feedback from senior students or professors to ensure it stands out
from the crowd.
- Don&#39;t give up! Keep practicing, seeking help, and pushing yourself to improve.
