Somya Lohani, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
her summer internship in Software Engineer  profile at Uber. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Microsoft Machine Learning Intern, Google Software Engineer, Microsoft Software Engineer, Sprinklr Software Engineer 

## Insights on the Selection Process
For Microsoft ML, I was extensively quizzed about my past projects which were mostly reinforcement learning based. I was also asked questions on the probability concepts relevant to machine learning and different classification and regression models and where and why those models were relevant. All the software roles that I interviewed for, required me to have a good command on competitive programming and DSA concepts. I had to code the  solutions to the problems in real time. Questions based on OOPS were also frequently asked. For most parts, the companies (Software roles) I interviewed for did not discuss my resume at length. 

##  Preparation Resources
Interviewbit, Leetcode Medium level problems, CSES problem set, GFG for topic wise revision of DSA concepts and Machine learning Course by Andrew Ng.  

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
The process can be very stressful since luck plays a decent amount of role while getting you through interview shortlists and interviews. The key is to have faith in yourself and surround yourself with a good set of friends who are just as motivated and have your best interests in mind. There is no one model that works for everyone, so spend time figuring out what works for you and follow it religiously.
