Suhani, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BTech student in ME will do
her summer internship in Product Supply profile at P&G. Here are some brief
insights of hers.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Microsoft – Data Science
● Microsoft – Technical
product manager
● P&G – Product Supply
● ITC
● Goldman Sachs
● BCG

## Insights on the Selection Process
1. Resume Shortlist – Good CPI (8+ mostly but not necessary),
projects, intern/ research experience is a plus, students with a
3
rd year POR are preferred.
2. 1 Psychometric test and 1 aptitude test. Each of about 40-60
min. Don’t remember the exact duration.
3. GD
a. In groups of 3, questions are asked to each person one
by one, more like a group interview
b. Case-based and HR questions
4. Interview Process
a. As seen in the last few years, only 2 people are selected
for the final interview after the GD. Both these
candidates are usually selected. The last round (just an
interaction round, lasted for 7-8 min) is mostly just
formality.

Insights on the
Selection Process

In any techno-managerial profile, resume should be really good
and well-rounded. GD preparation series by AnC council was more
than enough for me to prepare for GD part.
Both tests don’t require any prior preparation as such, just on the
spot pressure test.

Sample Interview
/Test Questions

Sample Psychometric test and aptitude test questions are
available on P&G website. Some of the GD qns I remember are:
Tell us sometime you handled a pressure situation effectively.
Tell us sometime you found a creative solution to a problem
Suppose one of your member/colleagues is contributing to the
project due to so and so reason.
There were some more, can’t recall

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Just be completely honest with your answers in the psychometric test. Every other question
would be some other form of the question asked before and they want to test your honesty
and mind stability over there. Don’t try to give completely idealistic answers and stay rigid on
your opinions.
