Garvit Arora, studying in IIT Kanpur as a B.Tech student in Electrical Engineering will do
his summer internship in Software profile at Samsung Electronics, South Korea. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
nan

## Insights on the Selection Process
The selection process was based basically on three criteria:
a. CPI
b. Coding skills
c. HR (unlike most of the other companies, not just for the
sake of it purpose)

##  Preparation Resources
Software:
- Interview bit
- CP-algorithms
- GFG
- Test series from archives by PClub
- Some YT videos (mostly from striver)
Quant:
- 50 challenging problems in probability by Frederick Mosteller
- Brainstellar

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
DOs:
- Take advice from seniors.
- Practice DSA as much as possible.
- After you are shortlisted for any company’s interview, find all the previously asked
questions by that company and solve them religiously.
- You can do this thing before the coding test of that company also (although much
lesser time is available once the coding tests start)
- During the interview, aim to exhibit confidence by speaking a little louder and with
clarity.
DONTs:
- Don’t focus too much on gathering more projects if you already have enough relevant
projects for your resume. It would be best if you have DSA + one more skill (ML,
WebD, or anything else). Take an SnT or Stamatics summer project if you need one
(they generally don’t require much effort).
- Well, don’t waste your time in the summer XD. Do enjoy, but within limits.
