Arpit Maheshwari, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in EE will do
his summer internship in Associate profile at SAMSUNG Electronics South Korea. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Graviton (Quant), Microsoft (SDE), DE Shaw (SDE)

## Insights on the Selection Process
People from CSE and EE branches were allowed to give the coding test

Coding test-
1. There was 1 coding test of 3 hours duration. The test consisted of 1 question.
2. The test was not too difficult. The time complexity bounds were also not too tight for the given constraints of the question which essentially meant that brute force solution also worked. Still, it was lengthy and one had to be careful with the edge cases. Apart from the number of test cases passed, the time taken to solve the problem was also a factor which was considered.

Interview-
1. It consisted of 2 rounds - HR and Technical
2. A coding question was asked in the technical round. It was based DP. The problem asked in the interview was based on Knapsack
3. The HR round had general questions like "Why do you want to work for Samsung?"," Do you know anything about Korean culture?", and things based on similar lines.

CGPA plays a crucial role in getting shortlisted. 14 people were shortlisted for the interview, out of which 6 were finally selected. Among those 6 people, 5 were from CSE and 1 from EE. These numbers generally remain similar every year.

##  Preparation Resources
1. For Coding- Interviewbit, leetcode, contests on Codeforces for time-bound practice. 
2. For Quant- Brainstellar, 50 challenging problems

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1. I would say that first chalk out a plan for yourself because every person is in a
different scenario with varied strengths/ weaknesses, so try and figure out what
works best for you.
2. Start early so that you have enough time to figure out things and prepare accordingly
3. Talk to seniors. This is very important since they are the people who have gone
through similar situations and can easily guide you throughout the process.
4. Finally, don't get bogged down by any hiccups that you may face. Stay focused
and don't let your self-confidence go down. It is easier said than done but then it is
the reality and it matters a lot.
