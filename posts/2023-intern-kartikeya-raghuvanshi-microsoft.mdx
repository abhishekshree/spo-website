Kartikeya Raghuvanshi, studying in IIT Kanpur as a B.T. student in Mechanical Engineering will do
his summer internship in Product Manager profile at Microsoft. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Microsoft
● ITC
● HUL

## Insights on the Selection Process
1- GD- It was more like idea pitching, focused on your quick
thinking. How good your idea was and how much time was
taken to come up with that idea. How quickly you can sell your
idea to the client and how much insight you have in tech world.
2- Technical- Technical side was questioned, from resume too.
One theme was provided and many different kinds of questions
were asked from that.
3- HR- Questions asked were based on resume. Questions
regarding projects and PoRs, what were your learnings from
them, how you managed them etc.
4- The 1st round was the one I found the hardest. The GD was not
your typical GD but individual problem solving instead.
5- Overall Experience was very nice. I am very interested in these
things . There were types of questions you have never solved,
can ask anything, mainly based on on-spot thinking.

##  Preparation Resources
- Not much preparation required. Just prepare for GD, practice guestimates and Interview
questions {SPO draft of general questions}
- Company or start-up problems. Know how to write a GD. Know the demands of your target
audience and their age-group. Focus on Famous GD problems. 1-2 weeks are enough.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
1- Think a lot about the applications we use daily in detail about all the services and uses
they provide
2- Look of improvement in apps you use daily. This thinking can help in such unique
selection process.
3- Develop your soft skills as they are a major part of any interview and even more so in
this process.
