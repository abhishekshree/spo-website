Pranshu Gaur, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BS student in MTH will do
his summer internship in Research Intern profile at Adobe. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
● Optiver – Quant [GD Round]
● Optiver – Software [Interview]
● Goldman Sachs – Software
[Interview]
● Adobe – Research [Interview]
● Edelweiss – Quant [Interview]

## Insights on the Selection Process
Firstly, prepare well for the coding question. Advanced DSA is not
required and just basic coding practice and thinking skills are enough to
crack the question. Next, we get a few questions from Probability and
Statistics. This is an important part of the whole selection procedure.
Prepare well for this, preferred courses to undertake are
MSO201/HSO201. These courses help in building the basic foundations
required to solve the problems. If you have not done these courses, you
can just study the resources related to it and it would be enough. I
would suggest solving some mental ability questions from Brainstellar,
these would help develop the insight needed. In the interview round, I
was given a problem statement regarding a probability question that
had a subjective answer, I answered the first part correctly, and the
interviewer then proceeded to ask different varieties of question on the
same problem statement. After that I was given another problem that
was an advanced version of the same problem statement, involving
Joint Probability Distribution, I thought about a minute or two and then
proceeded to elaborate my answer and the thought process behind it.

The most important part of the complete answer is not the correctness
of your solution, but the thought process behind it and how do you
correct yourself upon getting guidance and some hints from the
interviewer. Then the interviewer proceeded to ask some questions
similar to HR Rounds and the interview ended.

## Advice for students (dos and don’ts)? 
Do not panic in the interview if you are not able to answer the problem statement correctly,
just follow the hints given by the interviewer and explain your thought process behind the
problem. Try to be technical while answering and compose yourself well. Overall, the
interview process is interesting and easy if you are confident and have fundamental
knowledge of Probability and Statistics.
