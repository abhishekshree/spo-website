Atur Gupta, studying in IIT Kanpur as a BT student in CSE will do
his summer internship in Quant profile at Quadeye. Here are some brief
insights of his.

## Shortlisted Profiles & Companies:
Optiver - Quant, Tower Research - Quant, Alphagrep - Quant, Alphagrep - Software, DE Shaw - Software, Sprinklr - Software, Goldman Sachs - Analyst, Microsoft - Software

## Insights on the Selection Process
In all of the quant interviews (Alphagrep, Quadeye, Goldman Sachs) except Tower and Optiver, I was asked questions straight from the website Brainstellar and 50 challenging Problems book. In Tower, I was asked questions on standard deviation and variance on random variables, which was something I neither expected nor had prepared for. For optiver, you have to be really good at mental math and the concept of expectation in probability. 

##  Preparation Resources
1.) For Quant -  Brainstellar and 50 Challenging Problems 

2.) For Software -  Interviewbit mostly. Preferred solutions given in discussion section of leetcode for the same questions. 

## Advice for students (dos and donâ€™ts)? 
1.) If you're a student reading this before the summers, my first and most important advice would be for you to focus on increasing your cpi as much as you can. It is extremely important to get shortlisted in good companies. Definitely keep it above 9 if you're targeting Day 1 companies.
 
2.) As for software profiles, Competitive programming is a must for companies Google and Rubrik, and maybe Uber too. For other companies like sprinklr, microsoft, etc just interviewbit would be fine.  

3.) Now for Quant profiles, both brainstellar and 50 challenging problems, are necessary and sufficient. Do both of 'em twice at least. I was also asked mental math problems in some companies' interviews (Quadeye, Optiver). 

4.)Some general tips -  The projects and internships on your resume don't help much (at all?) in getting shortlisted for interviews. It's just CPI and tests. As for interviews, what's required is that you should be able to explain why you'd be a good fit for the company and the relevant role. For this, the relevant projects/internships can help.
